Michele Gulino is a Postdoctoral Researcher at TU Delft. His research focuses on toughening strategies for bi-material adhesively bonded joints, with particular emphasis on the use of structured interfaces to enhance joint performance.

During his PhD, Michele investigated the role of surface morphology in adhesively bonded joints with Laser Powder Bed Fused (LPBF) metal substrates. His work provided a detailed mechanistic interpretation of how the intrinsic LPBF surface topography contributes to toughening metal-composite joints, without relying on conventional surface treatments.
