Andrea Corrado is a PhD candidate at University of Trento, Italy. He got a master’s degree in Industrial engineering with a specialization in Mechatronics and in parallel he worked in the Formula Student team of the University in the mechanical department for five years. Since November 2023, he is following an Industrial PhD program, in collaboration with company ProM Facility, entitled “Development of industrial products through additive manufacturing of low-environmental-impact” under the supervision of Prof. Matteo Benedetti and Ing. Matteo Perini. A collaboration with Prof. Sofia Teixeira de Freitas started in 2024 with an internship of 6 months at Tu Delft. His work aims to enhance the interfacial properties of be-material junctions by introducing specific interlocking mechanisms, manufactured via Additive Manufacturing technology. A correlation between tests and Finite Element Models is performed and an optimization process is used to find the optimum configuration.
