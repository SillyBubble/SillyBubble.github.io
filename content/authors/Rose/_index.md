Rosemere de Araujo Alves Lima is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at IDMEC – Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon. She completed her PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, co-supervised by Prof. Andrea Bernasconi and Prof. Michele Carboni, where she worked on the structural health monitoring (SHM) of adhesively bonded joints using optical and acoustic emission methods. Her doctoral research integrated experimental mechanics, signal processing, and the design of adhesively bonded composites.

Rosemere's postdoctoral research focuses on architecting multifunctional bonded joints by embedding 3D-printed structures with toughening and self-sensing capabilities, contributing to the development of smart, high-performance, and reversible adhesives. She is deeply committed to developing sustainable structural solutions that align with the principles of the circular economy.
