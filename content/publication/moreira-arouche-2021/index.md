abstract: 'In this work, the influence of a layer of glass fiber mat (GFM) inserted
  in a bi-material bonded joint interface is investigated as a toughening mechanism
  to improve the fracture performance of bonded structures. Composite-to-metal bonded
  specimens were manufactured by hand lay-up using two different consolidation processes:
  at room pressure or using vacuum bagging. The fracture behavior was evaluated under
  quasi-static loadings using the mixed-mode bending (MMB) test. Test results revealed
  an increase of the fracture toughness with the insertion of an adjacent layer of
  GFM. The toughening mechanism is associated with a more irregular fracture surface
  profile. It was verified a relationship between the fracture surface roughness and
  the fracture toughness. The toughening effect showed to be more evident in higher
  mode II fracture conditions. The insertion of a layer of GFM and the use of vacuum
  pressure in the consolidation of the composite increase the fracture performance
  of composite repairs in metal structures.'
