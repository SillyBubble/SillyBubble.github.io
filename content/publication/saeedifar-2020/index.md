abstract: 'This study is devoted to the damage characterization of Non-Crimp Fabric
  (NCF), 2D plain-woven (2D-PW) and 3D orthogonal plain-woven (ORT-PW) carbon/epoxy
  laminates, subjected to compression after multiple-impact loading, using Acoustic
  Emission (AE). The ultrasonic C-scan images showed that the interlaminar damage
  area induced by the single and 3-impact in ORT-PW architecture is 3 and 2 times
  smaller than NCF and 2D-PW architectures respectively. The impacted specimens were
  then subjected to the in-plane compression load. Two indices, one based on the mechanical
  response and another one based on the AE behavior of the laminates, were proposed
  to compare the performance of different architectures. These indices showed that
  the ORT-PW had the best performance among all the architectures. Finally, AE was
  used to distinguish the different damage mechanisms including: matrix cracking,
  intra and inter-yarn debonding, defected-fiber breakage, intact-fiber breakage and
  z-binder fiber breakage in the CAI tests of the architectures.'
