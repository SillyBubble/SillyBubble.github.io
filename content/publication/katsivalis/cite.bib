 abstract = {Tow-Based Discontinuous Composites are a new class of composite materials which combine high strength and stiffness with in-plane isotropy and therefore have the potential to be used in high-end structural applications. However, an efficient connection method for TBDC components is currently lacking as bolted joints introduce defects and stress concentrations. On the other hand, adhesive joints are an unproven method especially considering the complicated micro-architecture of TBDCs. This work seeks to explore the quasi-static performance of TBDC adhesive joints under different loading conditions. Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and Single Lap Joint (SLJ) testing is performed using a moderate and a high toughness adhesive. The global joint response was analysed while Acoustic Emission (AE) was utilised to identify and characterise the different damage mechanisms experienced by the joints. Finally, fractography was also utilised to detect damage mechanisms in the fracture surfaces and validate the AE findings.},
