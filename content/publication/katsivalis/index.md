abstract: Tow-Based Discontinuous Composites are a new class of composite materials
  which combine high strength and stiffness with in-plane isotropy and therefore have
  the potential to be used in high-end structural applications. However, an efficient
  connection method for TBDC components is currently lacking as bolted joints introduce
  defects and stress concentrations. On the other hand, adhesive joints are an unproven
  method especially considering the complicated micro-architecture of TBDCs. This
  work seeks to explore the quasi-static performance of TBDC adhesive joints under
  different loading conditions. Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) and Single Lap Joint
  (SLJ) testing is performed using a moderate and a high toughness adhesive. The global
  joint response was analysed while Acoustic Emission (AE) was utilised to identify
  and characterise the different damage mechanisms experienced by the joints. Finally,
  fractography was also utilised to detect damage mechanisms in the fracture surfaces
  and validate the AE findings.
