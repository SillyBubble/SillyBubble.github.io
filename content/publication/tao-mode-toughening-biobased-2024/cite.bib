 abstract = {Bio-based epoxy materials face major challenges in their relatively poor mechanical properties compared to their petroleum-based competitors, including low fracture toughness and abrupt failure. By mimicking the molecular structure of spider silk, which is one of the toughest materials in nature, we manufactured polymer overlapping curls consisting of coiling fibers with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths through 3D printing. These curls were embedded in a bio-based epoxy aiming to improve its toughness. The bio-based epoxy adhesive layer integrated by such 3D-printed coiling fibers was tested under mode I opening load using Double Cantilever Beam tests. The results show an extrinsic bridging triggered by the embedded curls that promote progressive failure and improve the mode I fracture toughness by 285%. The proposed 3D-printed coiling fibers can improve the performance of biobased epoxies and retard crack growth, opening new horizons for their use in structural applications and the use of these bio-inspired overlapping curls to control crack growth in adhesively bonded joints.},
