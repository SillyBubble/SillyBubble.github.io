abstract: Bio-based epoxy materials face major challenges in their relatively poor
  mechanical properties compared to their petroleum-based competitors, including low
  fracture toughness and abrupt failure. By mimicking the molecular structure of spider
  silk, which is one of the toughest materials in nature, we manufactured polymer
  overlapping curls consisting of coiling fibers with sacrificial bonds and hidden
  lengths through 3D printing. These curls were embedded in a bio-based epoxy aiming
  to improve its toughness. The bio-based epoxy adhesive layer integrated by such
  3D-printed coiling fibers was tested under mode I opening load using Double Cantilever
  Beam tests. The results show an extrinsic bridging triggered by the embedded curls
  that promote progressive failure and improve the mode I fracture toughness by 285%.
  The proposed 3D-printed coiling fibers can improve the performance of biobased epoxies
  and retard crack growth, opening new horizons for their use in structural applications
  and the use of these bio-inspired overlapping curls to control crack growth in adhesively
  bonded joints.
