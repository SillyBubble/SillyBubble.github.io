abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate the enhanced off-axis properties of
  thin plies to improve the performance of adhesively bonded carbon fiber reinforced
  polymers. Single lap bonded joints with three different ply thicknesses of 200 $μ$m,
  100 $μ$m and 50 $μ$m were tested under quasi-static tensile loading. Acoustic Emission
  and Digital Image Correlation were used to monitor the damage and strain evolution
  of the overlap area during testing. 3D post-mortem failure analysis of the fracture
  surfaces were performed using a 3D profiling microscope. Experimental results show
  an increase of 16% in the lap shear strength and an increase of 21% in the strain
  energy when using the 50 $μ$m instead of 200 $μ$m ply thicknesses. However, Acoustic
  Emission measurements show that the damage initiation is postponed up to a 47% higher
  load when using 50 $μ$m instead of 200 $μ$m ply thicknesses. Moreover, the total
  amount of acoustic energy released from initiation up to final failure was significantly
  less with thin plies. A non-linear finite element analysis up to damage initiation
  indicates that with decreasing ply thickness, the damage onset inside the composite
  is postponed to higher loads and moves away from the adhesive interface towards
  the mid-thickness of the adherend. It is found that, decreasing the single ply thickness
  of laminated composite adherends in a single overlap bonded joint increases the
  maximum load and delays damage initiation of the joint, however the damage progression
  till final failure is more sudden.
