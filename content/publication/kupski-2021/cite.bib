 abstract = {Adhesive bonding is one of the most suitable joining technologies in terms of weight and mechanical performance for current carbon fiber reinforced polymer aircraft fuselage structures. However, traditional joint topologies such as single overlap joints induce high peel stresses, resulting in sudden failure and low joint strength when compared to metal adherends. This drawback in using carbon fiber reinforced polymer is hindering their performance and efficiency in full-scale structures where joints are essential. The goal of this paper is to review how the joint design can help to improve the lap shear strength of composite bonded joints, to recognize the challenges that still need to be understood and to give insight into new opportunities. The focus is thereby on means to increase the matrix-dominated out-of-plane strength of the adherend in order to postpone delamination failure, as it is known to be the most prone type of failure of composite bonded joints. The paper is divided in two main parts: firstly, a review of topology-related and material-related design parameters is given and secondly, future opportunities to improve out-of-plane strength of CFRP bonded joints yet to be explored are discussed.},
