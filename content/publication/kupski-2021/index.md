abstract: 'Adhesive bonding is one of the most suitable joining technologies in terms
  of weight and mechanical performance for current carbon fiber reinforced polymer
  aircraft fuselage structures. However, traditional joint topologies such as single
  overlap joints induce high peel stresses, resulting in sudden failure and low joint
  strength when compared to metal adherends. This drawback in using carbon fiber reinforced
  polymer is hindering their performance and efficiency in full-scale structures where
  joints are essential. The goal of this paper is to review how the joint design can
  help to improve the lap shear strength of composite bonded joints, to recognize
  the challenges that still need to be understood and to give insight into new opportunities.
  The focus is thereby on means to increase the matrix-dominated out-of-plane strength
  of the adherend in order to postpone delamination failure, as it is known to be
  the most prone type of failure of composite bonded joints. The paper is divided
  in two main parts: firstly, a review of topology-related and material-related design
  parameters is given and secondly, future opportunities to improve out-of-plane strength
  of CFRP bonded joints yet to be explored are discussed.'
