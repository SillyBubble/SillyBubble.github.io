abstract: 'This paper investigates the effect of the fabric architecture and the z-binding
  yarns on the compression after multiple impacts behavior of composites. Four fiber
  architectures are investigated: non-crimp fabric (NCF), 2D plain weave (2D-PW),
  3D orthogonal plain (ORT-PW) and twill (ORT-TW) weave. The specimens were subjected
  to single and multiple low-velocity impacts at different locations with the same
  energy level (15 J). Non-destructive techniques including ultrasonic C-scanning,
  X-ray CT and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) are employed to quantitatively analyze
  and capture the Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) induced in the specimens. Although
  the absorbed energy was approximately the same, damage was the least in 3D woven
  architectures. In the case of compression after impact, 3D woven composites demonstrated
  a progressive damage behavior with the highest residual strength ($∼$92%) while
  2D plain weave and NCF specimens showed suddenly catastrophic damage and the residual
  strength of $∼$65% and $∼$55% respectively.'
