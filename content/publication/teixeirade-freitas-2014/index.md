abstract: 'In this research, the adhesion properties of bonded composite-to-aluminium
  joints are evaluated using floating roller peel tests. Tests were performed using
  two different adhesives and different adherend lay-ups: composite-to-aluminium,
  composite-to-composite and aluminium-to-aluminium. The results show that floating
  roller peel tests, widely used in metal bonding, can also be used to assess adhesion
  properties of composite bonding and composite-to-aluminium bonding. However, attention
  should be paid on which results are important to take from the peel tests. In adhesion
  tests, the failure mode is more important than the failure load. The peel load can
  only be compared when using exactly the same type of flexible adherend. Even when
  the adhesion properties are good (cohesive failure), the peel load value can decrease
  up to a factor of 10 when peeling off a composite flexible adherend instead of an
  aluminium flexible adherend. Copyright Â© 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.'
