abstract: Parts manufactured with Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) are drawing interest
  in the adhesive joints research because of their high surface roughness, which is
  usually associated with good adhesion. This work aims to assess the adhesion strength
  of the inherent surface morphology of LPBF manufactured titanium. Double Cantilever
  Beam (DCB) tests were carried out to determine the mode I fracture toughness of
  joints comprising as-printed titanium (Ti6Al4V) adherends, namely titanium-titanium
  secondary bonded and titanium-Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) co-bonded joints.
  The effect of high-temperature oxidation on the fracture toughness was also evaluated
  by testing a batch of joints in which the titanium underwent a post-printing thermal
  treatment. The as-printed specimens were compared to the same type of joints but
  with sandblasted titanium adherends to evaluate the effect of this surface pre-treatment
  on the value of fracture toughness. The results indicate that non-oxidised titanium
  joints with untreated adherends had an average of 11% higher fracture toughness
  than their sandblasted counterparts. On the other hand, sandblasting proved beneficial
  for oxidised joints, increasing the fracture toughness by 64% on average over the
  untreated samples.
