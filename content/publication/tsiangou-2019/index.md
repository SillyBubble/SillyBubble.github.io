abstract: Thermoset composites can be made “weldable” by co-curing a neat thermoplastic
  coupling layer on the surface to be welded. With its exceptionally short heating
  times, ultrasonic welding is a highly promising technique for joining advanced thermoplastic
  (TPC) to thermoset (TSC) composites, since it can potentially prevent thermal degradation
  of the thermoset adherend. Previous research has shown successful results on ultrasonic
  welding of carbon fibre (CF)/epoxy and TPC using a PEI coupling layer. However,
  it is still not clear what the processing window is for ultrasonic welding of TSC
  to TPC, i.e. how much flexibility we have in choosing the process parameters while
  maintaining good weld strength. Hence, knowing the mechanisms that cause a reduction
  in weld strength is of great importance for the optimization of ultrasonic welding
  of dissimilar composites. On top of that, it is important to determine how the thickness
  of the coupling layer affects the span of the processing window, since precious
  research has shown that the thickness of the coupling layer affects the welding
  process and the weld strength. Thus, in this study, a processing window for welding
  CF/epoxy and CF/PEEK composites (i.e. hybrid welds) was defined and compared to
  the processing window for ultrasonic welding of CF/PEEK samples (i.e. reference
  welds). Samples were welded at different displacements of the sonotrode, also known
  as travel, and the mechanical performance of each batch was determined by single-lap
  shear tests. Moreover, the effect of the thickness of the coupling layer on the
  processing window was determined by investigating three different thicknesses. It
  was concluded that the processing window span is increasing with an increasing coupling
  layer thickness. Furthermore, the processing window of the hybrid welds is narrower
  than the processing window of the reference welds.
