abstract: This study investigates the fracture onset and crack deflection in multi-material
  adhesive joints with thick bond-lines ($â‰ˆ$10 mm) under global mode I loading. The
  role of adherend-adhesive modulus-mismatch and pre-crack length are scrutinized.
  The parameters controlling the crack path directional stability are also discussed.
  Single-material (i.e. steel-steel and GFRP-GFRP) and bi-material (i.e. steel-GFRP)
  double-cantilever beam joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive are tested.
  The joints are modelled analytically, considering a beam on elastic-plastic foundation,
  to include characteristic length scales of the problem (e.g. adhesive thickness,
  plastic zone) and numerically using Finite Element Model. An empirical relation,
  in terms of geometrical and material properties of the joints, that defines the
  transition between non-cohesive and cohesive fracture onset is found. Above a specific
  pre-crack length the stress singularity at pre-crack tip rules over the stress singularity
  near bi-material corners, resulting in mid-adhesive thickness cohesive fracture
  onset. However, the cracking direction rapidly deflects out from the adhesive layer
  centre-line. Positive T-stress along the crack tip is found to be one of the factors
  for the unstable crack path.
