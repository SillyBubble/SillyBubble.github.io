 abstract = {The curing behaviour and the mechanical behaviour of susceptor-assisted induction-cured adhesively bonded joints has been investigated. Induction Heating (IH) was established by mixing Iron particles into a two component epoxy paste adhesive. The effect of different process parameters, such as particle content, coupling distance and coil current, on the IH curing process was evaluated by experimental tests and simulation of the induction heating process in COMSOL multiphysics. The process simulation showed that hysteresis losses has a major contribution for the heat generation of IH using Iron particles. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was used to assess the effect of susceptor particles on the cure behaviour of the adhesive. The results showed that the Iron particles do not interfere with the curing process of the epoxy adhesive in scope.},
