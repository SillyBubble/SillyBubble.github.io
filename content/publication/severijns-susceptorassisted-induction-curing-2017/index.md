abstract: The curing behaviour and the mechanical behaviour of susceptor-assisted
  induction-cured adhesively bonded joints has been investigated. Induction Heating
  (IH) was established by mixing Iron particles into a two component epoxy paste adhesive.
  The effect of different process parameters, such as particle content, coupling distance
  and coil current, on the IH curing process was evaluated by experimental tests and
  simulation of the induction heating process in COMSOL multiphysics. The process
  simulation showed that hysteresis losses has a major contribution for the heat generation
  of IH using Iron particles. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was
  used to assess the effect of susceptor particles on the cure behaviour of the adhesive.
  The results showed that the Iron particles do not interfere with the curing process
  of the epoxy adhesive in scope.
