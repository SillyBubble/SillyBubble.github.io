abstract: Adhesive joints are frequently exposed to cyclic ageing conditions during
  their service life, which can have a substantial impact on the mechanical properties
  of both the adhesive and the substrates. The safe life philosophy, commonly employed
  in the design of bonded joints, underscores the importance of obtaining an accurate
  estimate of the adhesive's durability. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the
  predictive capabilities of the adhesive's mechanical behavior under cyclic ageing
  conditions. This research aims to expand the use of quasi-static cohesive zone modelling
  (CZM) for damage and fracture analysis of dissimilar adhesive joints subjected to
  cyclic ageing environments. The first step involved measuring the mechanical properties
  of the adhesive through tensile tests on unaged and cyclically aged dogbone specimens,
  considering their moisture content and ageing cycles. Based on the results, a degradable
  CZM was developed. To validate the numerical model, dissimilar double cantilever
  beam specimens (DCBs) of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aluminium were
  manufactured and tested before and after ageing. The load-displacement curves of
  the bi-materials bonded joints were successfully predicted using the developed model
  where the properties of the material are defined as a function of the moisture uptake
  and ageing cycles at each material element. The obtained results showed that after
  4 ageing cycles, the maximum load of DCB specimens decrease considerably.
