abstract: 'Autoclave manufacturing of fibre metal laminates, such as GLARE, is an
  expensive process. Therefore, there is an increasing interest to find cost-effective
  out-of-autoclave manufacturing processes without diminishing the laminate quality.
  The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of fibre metal laminate panels
  adhesively bonded and cured using resistance heating. Three manufacturing processes
  are compared for different layups with an embedded steel mesh at the mid-plane:
  autoclave curing, resistance bonding of two (autoclave-cured) panels and complete
  out-of-autoclave resistance curing of panels. Interlaminar shear strength tests
  and optical microscopy analysis showed that resistance bonding is a promising technique,
  leading to results comparable to autoclave curing. Resistance curing led to an interlaminar
  shear strength decrease of 30–60%. A study of the correlation between degree of
  cure and distance from the mesh revealed the potential of resistance bonding to
  be used for flexible embedded mesh geometries and on-site repairs.'
