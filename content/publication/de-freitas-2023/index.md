abstract: 'The bondline thickness is a crucial parameter affecting the strength and
  toughness of adhesive joints. This parameter is responsible for the stress distribution,
  and thus, the efficiency of the stress transfer between the adherends, the failure
  modes, and the correspondent failure loads. However, the available literature reports
  different trends and relationships during testing between the thickness and strength,
  or thickness and toughness. In this chapter, the effect of adhesive thickness on
  the mechanical properties of adhesive joints is explored using the fracture mechanics
  framework. Two testing cases are discussed in detail: (i) soft bondlines joining
  rigid adherends, that is, butt joint and single end notch testing specimens, and
  (ii) rigid bondlines joining flexible adherends, that is, double cantilever beam
  geometry. These cases represent two extremes in terms of where the energy is stored
  while testing: in the first one, the energy is stored in the adhesive while in the
  second, the energy is stored in the adherends. From this discussion, the bondline
  thickness emerges as a critical geometrical parameter dictating transition between
  the two extreme cases. A single theoretical framework is provided that merges the
  two cases and is used to disclose the recently obtained experimental results.'
