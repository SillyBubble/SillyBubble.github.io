abstract: Using adhesives for connection technology has many benefits. It is cost-efficient,
  fast, and allows homogeneous stress distribution between the bonded surfaces. This
  paper gives an overview on the current state of knowledge regarding the technologically
  important area of adhesive materials, as well as on emergent related technologies.
  It is expected to fill some of the technological gaps between the existing literature
  and industrial reality, by focusing at opportunities and challenges in the adhesives
  sector, on sustainable and eco-friendly chemistries that enable bio-derived adhesives,
  recycling and debonding, as well as giving a brief overview on the surface treatment
  approaches involved in the adhesive application process, with major focus on metal
  and polymer matrix composites. Finally, some thoughts on the connection between
  research and development (R&D) efforts, industry standards and regulatory aspects
  are given. It contributes to bridge the gap between industry and research institutes/academy.
  Examples from the aeronautics industry are often used since many technological advances
  in this industry are innovation precursors for other industries. This paper is mainly
  addressed to chemists, materials scientists, materials engineers, and decision-makers.
