abstract: © 2019 Elsevier Ltd The aim of this research is to study the influence of
  moisture absorption at low moisture contents on the creep behaviour of an epoxy
  adhesive in steel bonded joints. Single lap joints were manufactured using high
  strength steel adherends and a two-component epoxy adhesive. The single lap joints
  were tested at load levels corresponding to average lap shear stresses of ± 5%,
  15%, 30% and 45% of the dry lap shear strength in both 40 °C air and 40 °C distilled
  water. Specimens were not pre-aged to be able to analyse the coupled effect of moisture
  and loading. The test results show that an increase in the load level resulted in
  an increase in the instantaneous strain and in the creep strain rate. The creep
  strain of single lap joints loaded in water was generally larger than for the ones
  loaded in air. For joints loaded in water the creep behaviour was found to be dependent
  on the moisture concentration in the adhesive. At low moisture percentages creep
  was suppressed, resulting in a lower instantaneous strain. At higher moisture percentages
  creep was promoted, resulting in a larger strain rate. The suppression of creep
  at low moisture percentages is attributed to water molecules bonding to the epoxy
  macromolecules, resulting in a reduction in molecular mobility and a smaller creep
  strain. At higher moisture percentages the plasticizing effect of the water dominates,
  resulting in a larger creep strain. The Maxwell three-element solid model and Kelvin-Voigt
  three-element solid model were used to simulate the creep behaviour of the single
  lap joints loaded in air and water. The models gave good representations of the
  creep response across the different load levels in both water and air, they were
  however unable to give a correct representation of the instantaneous strain of the
  single lap joints loaded in water. This is attributed to the models being unable
  to account for the present short-term relaxation process that is dependent on the
  moisture concentration.
