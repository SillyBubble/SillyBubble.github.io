 abstract = {Â© 2020 The Author(s) This study investigates the early fatigue damage of cross-ply carbon/epoxy laminates. The aim is to unfold the damage accumulation process, understand the interaction between different damage mechanisms, and quantify their contribution to stiffness degradation. Tension-tension fatigue tests were performed, while edge observation and DIC technique monitored the damage evolution. It was found that different accumulation process and interactive levels between transverse matrix cracks and delamination exist for specimens with similar stiffness degradation. A linear increase of stiffness degradation was observed with the increase of matrix crack density, while the growing trend of stiffness degradation converged with the increase of delamination.},
