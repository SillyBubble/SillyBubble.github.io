abstract: Â© 2020 The Author(s) This study investigates the early fatigue damage of
  cross-ply carbon/epoxy laminates. The aim is to unfold the damage accumulation process,
  understand the interaction between different damage mechanisms, and quantify their
  contribution to stiffness degradation. Tension-tension fatigue tests were performed,
  while edge observation and DIC technique monitored the damage evolution. It was
  found that different accumulation process and interactive levels between transverse
  matrix cracks and delamination exist for specimens with similar stiffness degradation.
  A linear increase of stiffness degradation was observed with the increase of matrix
  crack density, while the growing trend of stiffness degradation converged with the
  increase of delamination.
