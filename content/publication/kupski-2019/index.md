abstract: © 2019 The Authors Single lap bonded joints with four different composite
  adherend stacking sequences were tested and numerically simulated. The aim was to
  evaluate the effect of the layups on the quasi-static tensile failure of the bonded
  joints. The study shows that increasing the adherends bending stiffness postpones
  the damage initiation in the joint. However, this is no longer valid for final failure.
  The ultimate load is influenced by how the damage progresses. For similar bending
  stiffness, a layup that leads to the crack propagating from the adhesive towards
  the inside layers of the composite increases the ultimate load. The failure mode
  is highly influenced by the orientation of the interface lamina in contact with
  the adhesive, such that, a 0° interface ply causes failure within the bond line,
  while a 90° interface ply causes failure inside the composite adherend. Finally,
  it is concluded that a quasi-isotropic layup may not be the best choice in terms
  of tensile joint strength. In order to improve tensile strength up to damage initiation,
  the layup should be optimized for bending stiffness, while up to final failure,
  a stacking sequence that yields to a complex crack path inside the composite can
  lead to higher ultimate loads.
