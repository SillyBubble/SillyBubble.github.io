abstract: Nowadays, the use of composite laminated structures in the automobile, railroad,
  civil, aeronautical, space and naval industries is growing at a huge rate. Recently,
  there has been a renewed interest in sandwich laminated structures, whose bending
  capability and performance is much better when compared to classical laminates.
  Sandwich structures, which are mainly used as bending components, are formed by
  materials with very different stiffness in the faces and in the core. Therefore
  the behaviour of such structures under bending conditions does not fit the classical
  laminate theories. Despite this, sandwich structures are simple enough to allow
  simplified analysis, whose mathematical accuracy depends greatly on the structure
  itself. In this paper the goal is to study and validate the application in bending
  of a developed sandwich beam element with transverse compressibility of the core.
  This element uses a mixed layerwise approach by considering a higher-order shear
  deformation theory (HSDT) to represent the displacement field of the core and a
  first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for the face layers. Results are compared
  with three-dimensional finite element solutions and validation is also conducted
  with values retrieved experimentally. © Civil-Comp Press, 2012.
