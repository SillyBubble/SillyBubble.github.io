abstract: The renovation solution for orthotropic steel bridge decks studied consists
  of bonding a second steel plate to the existing steel deck in order to reduce the
  stresses and increase the lifespan of the orthotropic bridge deck. A parametric
  study was carried out on the flexural behaviour of beams representing the renovation
  solution using experimental and analytical studies. The influence of different thicknesses,
  temperatures and spans was tested. The results obtained for the stress reduction
  factor show that it is independent of temperature. More efficient solutions can
  be achieved when minimizing the second steel plate thickness and maximizing the
  adhesive layer thickness reducing the weight and increasing the stiffness of the
  composite structure. Both elastic behaviour and yield load of the composite beams
  are dominated by the steel plate properties and therefore not affected significantly
  by temperature. However, the ultimate failure of the beams occurs by shear of the
  adhesive layer, the properties of which are affected by temperature. Â© 2009 Elsevier
