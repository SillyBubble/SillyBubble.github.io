abstract: 'This paper addresses the fracture behaviour of bonded composite plates
  featuring a kissing bond along the crack growth path. Double cantilever beam (DCB)
  experiments are carried out under a displacement controlled loading condition to
  acquire the load response. The experimental data are collected and analysed analytically
  for specimens with and without kissing bond. The following aspects are observed
  and discussed: effect of the adhesive carrier film, non-smooth crack growth and
  rising R curve. An analytical model taking into account the aforementioned effects
  is proposed. The kissing bond leads to unstable crack growth resulting in a loss
  of the load carrying capacity. The presence of the knit carrier in the adhesive
  film results in the crack growth process characteristic for the stick-slip phenomena
  and a significant increase of the resistance to fracture of the bondline by triggering
  a bridging phenomenon. The model shows a very good agreement with the experimental
  data. A sound understanding of the fracture process is gained enabling analysis
  and prediction of the effects of kissing bonds and supporting carrier.'
