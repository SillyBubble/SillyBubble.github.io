abstract: The aim of this study is to assess the interlaminar adhesion of carbon-epoxy
  laminates under salt water condition. Carbon-epoxy laminate specimens were immersed
  in a salt water tank for 60 days. Some specimens were then dried at room temperature
  for 280 days, until recovering their initial weight. Specimens were tested using
  the composite peel test, an adaptation of the floating roller peel tests for composite
  materials. The results showed a degradation of peel strength in some areas due to
  the ageing process. The drying process did not affect the test results. A scanning
  electron microscopic analysis carried out on the fracture surface of the specimens
  revealed a typical mode I failure microstructure. A mixture of matrix failure and
  fibre/matrix interfacial failure was observed in non-aged specimens. Finally, a
  chemical characterization of the fracture surfaces with energy-dispersive spectroscopy
  confirmed the penetration of salt water in regions near the edge of the specimens.
  A degradation of the fibre/matrix interface adhesion was observed in affected areas.
  Floating roller peel tests proved to be a fast and effective method to access the
  interlaminar adhesion performance of composite laminates.
