abstract: 'Two systems for reinforcing \"in-service\" orthotropic bridge decks (OBDs)
  have been researched: the bonded steel plates system and the sandwich steel plates
  system. The main idea of these types of reinforcements is to stiffen the existing
  deck plate, thereby reducing the stress at the fatigue-sensitive details, and thus
  extending the fatigue life of the OBD. Both reinforcement systems consist of adding
  a second steel plate to the existing steel deck. The behaviour and the effect of
  the reinforcement systems on full-scale OBD are investigated. Full-scale static
  tests and finite element analyses were performed on reinforced deck panels, using
  realistic wheel loads. The results showed at least 40% of stress reduction close
  to the fatigue-sensitive details after applying both reinforcements. The two suggested
  reinforcement systems showed a good performance and proved to be efficient lightweight
  solutions to refurbish orthotropic bridge decks anDextend their life span.'
