 abstract = {© The Author(s) 2019. This work is intended to characterize the mechanical behavior of hybrid carbon–glass composite plates under combined loading of bending and torsion, and to determine the optimal ply fiber orientations to minimize the maximum out-of-plane displacement under such loading conditions. Hybrid composite plates were manufactured with 10 plies each and different stacking sequences using hand lay-up, with carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforcements in an epoxy matrix. Two experimental setups (involving two distinct boundary conditions) are here considered to test the composite plates, both simulating combined loading of bending and torsion. Numerical simulations of the experimental tests were performed in ABAQUS® and validated with the experimental data. Using the ply fiber orientations as design variables, the hybrid composite plates were then optimized using global and local optimization using direct search (GLODS). The objective function of minimization of the maximum out-of-plane displacement is carried out through an interactive cycle between GLODS and ABAQUS®. Specimens of three optimized laminates were also manufactured for experimental validation. The optimization process contributed to improve the performance of the hybrid composite plates in more than 30% when compared to some non-optimized plates.},
