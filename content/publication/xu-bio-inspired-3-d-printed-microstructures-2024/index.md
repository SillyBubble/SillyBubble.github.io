abstract: Aiming to aid the sustainable transition to fossil fuel-free epoxy materials
  and enhance the toughness of bio-based epoxies, here we integrate an overlapping
  curl microstructure consisting of coiling fiber with sacrificial bonds and hidden
  lengths into a bio-based epoxy matrix. Inspired by natural material, where exceptional
  properties are achieved at low environmental cost, the microstructure mimics the
  molecular structures of spider silk, known for its exceptional fracture resistance.
  The 3D-printed overlapping curl shows a saw-tooth mechanical response with continuous
  load-carrying ability thanks to the break of sacrificial bonds and unfolding of
  the hidden lengths. By embedding the overlapping curl into the compact-tension configuration
  of the bio-based epoxy, an extrinsic toughening mechanism is triggered as the hidden
  length unfolds. Experimental results show that a single-sided overlapping curl structure
  is able to improve the toughness of bio-based epoxy by 19%.
