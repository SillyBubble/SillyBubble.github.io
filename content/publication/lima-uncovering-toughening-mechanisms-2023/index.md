abstract: Aiming to increase damage tolerance of adhesively bonded joints, this work
  explores the influence of CFRP layup of the adherends on the crack onset and crack
  propagation of composite bonded joints under mode I loading. Quasi-static Double
  Cantilever Beam tests were performed using four different CFRP layups bonded with
  two adhesives. Parallel to the experimental program, finite element analyses were
  performed to aid in understanding and identifying the various damage mechanisms
  in each specimen type. The results show that the CFRP layup and adhesive fracture
  toughness significantly influence the joint fracture phenomena at crack onset and
  further crack propagation. An enhancement of the joint's mode I fracture toughness
  values at crack onset was observed in the specimens where a crack competition between
  the propagation within the bondline and the composite's layers was triggered. During
  crack propagation, the fracture toughness of the joint increases at crack deflections
  between the different plies of the CFRP layup until reaching the 0$^âˆ˜$ ply, where
  sudden delamination occurs. It has been shown that CFRP layup tailoring is a promising
  toughening method that, when carefully designed, has the potential to increase the
  maximum effective fracture toughness up to 100% when compared to pure cohesive failure.
