abstract: 'High performance structures require the use of different materials to meet
  their demanding requirements. Especially fibre reinforced polymer composites are
  nowadays often bonded to metals in order to take the most advantage of the materials
  properties and to minimize their disadvantages. However, the interface in such bi-material
  assemblies often represents the weakest point and thus has to be carefully addressed
  to ensure structural integrity. This review paper presents an overview of the research
  on bi-material interface crack problems over the past 30 years. Three categories
  of the research are discussed: mechanical testing, crack driving force and mode
  partitioning. The literature reveals that the key element to the fracture analysis
  of the bi-material interface crack is how to perform the mode partitioning. The
  proposed theories for mode partitioning by many researchers are meaningful yet underdeveloped
  and need further experimental validation.'
