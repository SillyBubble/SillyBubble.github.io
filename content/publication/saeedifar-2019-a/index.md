abstract: The aim of the present study is to characterize the damage in bi-material
  steel-to-composite double-lap adhesively-bonded joints using Acoustic Emission (AE).
  Two different structural adhesives, a ductile (Methacrylate-based) and brittle (Epoxy-based),
  were used to bond CFRP skins to a steel core. The fabricated joints were loaded
  in tension while damage evolution was monitored by AE. Due to the difference in
  the fracture nature of the adhesives “ductile vs. brittle”, different damage mechanisms
  were observed; including cohesive failure within the adhesive layer, steel deformation,
  failure at the adhesive/adherends interface (adhesive failure) and delamination
  in the CFRP skin. To classify these damages by AE, the AE features of each damage
  mechanism were first obtained by conducting standard tests on the individual constituents.
  Then, these AE reference patterns were used to train an ensemble decision tree classifier.
  The best parameters of the ensemble model were obtained by Bayesian optimization,
  and the confusion matrix showed that the model was sufficiently trained with the
  accuracy of 99.5% and 99.8% for Methacrylate-based and Epoxy-based specimens respectively.
  Afterwards, the trained model was used to classify the AE signals of the double-lap
  specimens. The AE demonstrated that the dominant damage mechanisms in the case of
  the Methacrylate-based were cohesive and adhesive failures while in the case of
  the Epoxy-based they were CFRP skin failure and adhesive failure. These results
  were consistent with the Digital Image Correlation, Fiber Optic Sensor and camera
  results. This study demonstrates the potential of AE technique for damage characterization
  of adhesively-bonded bi-material joints.
