abstract: 'The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the adherend material
  on the mode I fracture behaviour of bi-material composite bonded joints. Both single-material
  (steel-steel and composite-composite) and bi-material (steel-composite) joints bonded
  with a structural epoxy adhesive are studied. Additionally, two adhesive bondline
  thicknesses are considered: 0.4 mm (thin bondline) and 10.1 mm (thick bondline).
  The Penado-Kanninen reduction scheme is applied to evaluate the mode I strain energy
  release rate. The results show that the mode I fracture energy, GIc, is independent
  of the adherend type and joint configuration (single or bi-material). GIc shows
  average values between 0.60 and 0.72 N/mm for thin bondlines and 0.90â€“1.10 N/mm
  for thick bondlines. For thin bondlines, the failure is cohesive and the similar
  degree of constraint that is imposed to the adhesive by the high-modulus (i.e.,
  steel) and/or relatively thick (i.e., composite) adherends results in similar values
  of GIc for both single- and bi-material joint types. For thick bondlines, the crack
  grows closer to one of the adhesive-adherend interfaces, but still within the adhesive.
  The results show that the adhesive could deform similarly, although the crack has
  been constrained on one side by different types of adherends, either a steel or
  composite.'
