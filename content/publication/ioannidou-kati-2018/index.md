abstract: Steel-to-glass laminated connections, which have recently been developed,
  limit stress intensifications on the glass and combine strength and transparency.
  Transparent Structural Silicone Adhesive (TSSA) connections have been used in several
  projects worldwide; however, the hyperelastic and viscoelastic nature of the material
  has to date not been fully investigated. In this work, the first objective is to
  investigate the mechanical response of TSSA connections under static and cyclic
  loading by means of experimental tests. Firstly, the shear behaviour of TSSA circular
  connections is characterized by means of monotonic and cyclic loading tests. The
  adhesive exhibits significant stress-softening under repeated cycles that becomes
  more severe as the maximum load increases. Secondly, TSSA circular connections are
  subjected to monotonic and cyclic tensile loading of increasing maximum load. The
  way whitening propagates on the adhesive surface shows some consistency comparing
  the cases of static and cyclic loading. The second objective is to analytically
  describe the deformation behaviour of the adhesive based on hyperelastic prediction
  models. Uniaxial and biaxial tension tests are combined with the simple shear tests,
  for the material characterization of TSSA. The hyperelastic material parameters
  are calibrated by a simultaneous multi-experiment-data-fit based on the nonlinear
  least squares optimization method. The softening behaviour observed in shear tests
  is modeled based on a simplified pseudo-elastic damage model proposed by Ogdenâ€“Roxburgh.
  A first attempt is also made to model the actual softening response of the adhesive.
  A less conservative approach proposed by Guo, also based on the theory of pseudo-elasticity,
  proved to give a good approximation of the actual cyclic response of the adhesive.
