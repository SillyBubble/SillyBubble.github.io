abstract: Adhesive bonding is one of the most suitable joining technologies in terms
  of weight and mechanical performance for current carbon fiber reinforced polymer
  aircraft fuselage structures. However, traditional joint topologies such as single
  overlap joints induce high peel stresses, resulting in sudden failure and low joint
  strength when compared to metal adherends. This drawback in using carbon fiber reinforced
  polymer is hindering their performance and efficiency in full-scale structures where
  joints are essential.
