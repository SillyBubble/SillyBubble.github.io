abstract: 'Two synthesized eco-epoxy components based on TA: (A) glycidyl ether and
  (B) glycidyl phosphate ester, are used, as a replacement for the Bisphenol A (BPA)
  based epoxy component, for bonding aluminum (Al) and carbon fiber reinforced polymer
  (CFRP). Their effect on the mode I fracture toughness (GI) is evaluated by Double
  Cantilever Beam (DCB) testing while using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for in-situ
  crack tip monitoring. Compared to the reference adhesive, an improvement of (GI)
  of Al (43%) and CFRP (100%) is obtained when using adhesive B. Moreover, regardless
  of the adherend material, a stick-slip pattern of crack growth is observed. Weak
  adhesion of the reference adhesive leads to an adhesive failure vs. a cohesive-adhesive
  failure in the case of adhesive B. On the contrary, the modification of adhesive
  A has an adverse effect on the GI of Al (−33%) and CFRP (−78%) as opposed to their
  reference counterparts.'
