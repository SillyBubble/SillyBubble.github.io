abstract: Nowadays, dissimilar adhesive joints are used widely in different industrial
  sectors. For this type of joints, the investigation of the fracture behaviour under
  pure mode I loading is a vital issue. In order to study mode I fracture parameters
  of adhesive joints, scientists have proposed standard double cantilever beam (DCB)
  specimens. In dissimilar DCB adhesive joints, because of material asymmetry, obtaining
  pure mode I is challenging. To obtain pure mode I loading in dissimilar DCB joints,
  scientists have proposed two criteria based on (1) the flexural stiffness and (2)
  the distribution of the longitudinal strain along the bondline. However, the achievement
  of pure mode I in dissimilar DCB joints needs more research. In this paper, the
  mode-mixity in dissimilar DCB joints designed based on the two mentioned criteria
  is investigated numerically and experimentally. Metal-composite DCBs were fabricated
  and tested. During the tensile tests, the horizontal and vertical displacement fields
  of the adhesive layer were calculated using digital image correlation (DIC) and
  the finite element method (FEM). Based on the obtained displacement fields and using
  Williams' series expansion, the mode-mixities were investigated. The results show
  that in order to achieve pure mode I loading in steel-composite joints, the criterion
  based on longitudinal strain is more suitable and in aluminium-composite joints
  the mode-mixities given by two criteria are almost the same.
