 abstract = {Orthotropic steel bridges have experienced early fatigue cracks at several welded connections in the steel deck plate. One of the possible strengthening systems to enlarge the fatigue life of the existing decks consists of bonding a second steel plate to the existing deck. This renovation technique was for the first time applied on the orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn. This article describes the results of the structural monitoring carried out to evaluate the short-term and long-term performance of the strengthening system. Static and dynamic controlled load tests were carried out using a calibrated truck. Strain history measurements were recorded continuously during 1 year from the normal traffic running on the bridge. The short-term measurements show significant decrease of the stress level at the bridge deck after the renovation, especially at the deck plate details. The stresses at the welds between the deck plate and the stiffener web reduce approximately 55% at the deck plate side and 35% at the stiffener web side. Due to this reduction, the fatigue life of these welds is expected to increase 11 times at the deck plate side and 3.6 times at the stiffener side. The long-term measurements do not show significant changes in the stress level at the bridge deck during the year of monitoring. The strengthening system has demonstrated good performance reliability to prolong the life span of the movable orthotropic bridges. Â© The Author(s) 2012.},
