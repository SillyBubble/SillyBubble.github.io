abstract: Orthotropic steel bridges have experienced early fatigue cracks at several
  welded connections in the steel deck plate. One of the possible strengthening systems
  to enlarge the fatigue life of the existing decks consists of bonding a second steel
  plate to the existing deck. This renovation technique was for the first time applied
  on the orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn. This article describes
  the results of the structural monitoring carried out to evaluate the short-term
  and long-term performance of the strengthening system. Static and dynamic controlled
  load tests were carried out using a calibrated truck. Strain history measurements
  were recorded continuously during 1 year from the normal traffic running on the
  bridge. The short-term measurements show significant decrease of the stress level
  at the bridge deck after the renovation, especially at the deck plate details. The
  stresses at the welds between the deck plate and the stiffener web reduce approximately
  55% at the deck plate side and 35% at the stiffener web side. Due to this reduction,
  the fatigue life of these welds is expected to increase 11 times at the deck plate
  side and 3.6 times at the stiffener side. The long-term measurements do not show
  significant changes in the stress level at the bridge deck during the year of monitoring.
  The strengthening system has demonstrated good performance reliability to prolong
  the life span of the movable orthotropic bridges. Â© The Author(s) 2012.
