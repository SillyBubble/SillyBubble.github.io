abstract: 'The goal of this study is to explore new topologies for adhesively bonded
  composite overlap joints in order to improve their strength under tensile loading.
  Multiple stacked overlaps, also referred as finger joints, are compared with single
  overlap topologies. The quasi-static tensile behaviour of single lap joints with
  two overlap lengths 12.7 mm and 25.4 mm are compared to finger joints with 1 and
  2 stacked overlaps through thickness with constant 12.7 mm overlap length. Two composite
  adherend stacking sequences are tested for each topology [0/90]4s and [90/0]4s.
  A non-linear FE-analysis is performed to analyse the shear and peel stresses along
  the adhesive bond line. A difference in peak shear and peel stress, at the tip of
  the bonded region could be observed: (i) for 1 finger, the peak peel stress is higher
  than in the single lap joint configurations because the beneficial effect of avoiding
  eccentricity in the finger joint is outperformed by the detrimental effect of reducing
  to half the adherend stiffness at the overlap; (ii) for 2 fingers, the stress field
  changes significantly leads to a 23% decrease in peak shear and 33% in peak peel
  stress, compared to the single lap joint topologies. In addition, experimental lap
  shear tests are performed and monitored using acoustic emission technique, to follow
  the damage events. Different trends at damage initation and at maximum load are
  believed to result from how the damage propagates inside the joint. A topology with
  2 fingers and layup [90/0]4s, which fails entirely inside the adherend, provides
  the lowest peak shear and peel stress and the highest load at damage initiation.
  It is however outperformed in maximum load by a single lap joint topology with layup
  [0/90]4s, with mostly cohesive failure. It is further found that, unlike in single
  overlap topologies, the most dominant stress component for damage initiation inside
  the finger joints is the in-plane tensile stress, at the butt joint resin pockets,
  rather than peel stresses at the overlap region. Lastly, if weight efficiency is
  the main requirement, a finger joint design can effectively replace a single overlap
  joint design. However, for absolute maximum joint strength, the single overlap joint
  is a better choice than the finger joint.'
