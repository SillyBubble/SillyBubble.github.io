  The increasing use of Adhesively-bonded joints in industrial applications resulted
  in more attention to damage assessment in these joints. The aim of the present study
  is to characterize the damage in bi-material double-lap adhesively-bonded joints
  by Acoustic Emission (A E). Two different structural adhesives, representing a ductile
  (Methacrylate-based) and brittle (epoxy-based) types, were used to bond C F R P
  skins to a steel core. The fabricated joints were loaded in tension while damage
  evolution was monitored by A E . Due to the difference in the fracture nature of
  the adhesives \"brittle vs. ductile\", different damage mechanisms occurred in the
  specimens; including adhesive layer failure, steel deformation, adhesive/adherends
  interfacial debonding and delamination in the C F R P skin. In order to distinguish
  and classify these damage types by A E, the AE features of each damage mechanism
  were first obtained by conducting some standard tests on the individual constituent
  materials. Then, these AE reference patterns were used to train an ensemble decision
  tree classifier. Finally, the trained model classified the AE signals of the double-lap
  tests and the images captured by camera were utilized to verify AE results. This
  study demonstrates the potential of AE technique for damage characterization of
  the adhesively-bonded bi-material joints.
