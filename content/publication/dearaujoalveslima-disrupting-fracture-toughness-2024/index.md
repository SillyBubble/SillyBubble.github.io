abstract: This work aims to improve the damage tolerance of secondary adhesively bonded
  joints under quasistatic mode I loading conditions by architecting the carbon fibre-reinforced
  polymer substrates' stacking sequences [1]. Double Cantilever Beam tests show that
  architecting the stacking sequence of the laminates composite substrates in combination
  with the adhesive layer's fracture toughness affects the crack onset and triggers
  different crack paths throughout the joints' thickness. In specimens bonded with
  a low-toughness bi-component adhesive, the tailored design, including a co-cured
  toughening layer, could increase the effective fracture toughness of the composite
  bonded joints up to 200%. From this study, it was possible to recognise the complexity
  and benefits of moving from the traditional cohesive failure to outbreaking multiple
  crack path propagation.
