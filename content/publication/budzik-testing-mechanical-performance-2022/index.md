abstract: The development of new adhesives has allowed to expand the application of
  bonding into the most diverse industrial fields. This review article presents the
  commonly used experimental methods for the investigation of mechanical performance
  of adhesively bonded joints in the aerospace, wind energy, automotive and civil
  engineering sectors. In these sectors, due to their excellent intrinsic properties,
  composite materials are often used along with conventional materials such as steel,
  concrete and aluminium. In this context, and due to the limitations that the traditional
  joining techniques present, adhesive joints are an excellent alternative. However,
  standardized experimental procedures are not always applicable for testing representative
  adhesive joints in these industries. Lack of relevant regulations across the different
  fields is often overcome by the academia and companies' own regulations and standards.
  Additional costs are thus mitigated to the industrial sectors in relation with the
  certification process which effectively can deprive even the biggest companies from
  promoting adhesive bonding. To ensure continuous growth of the adhesive bonding
  field the new international standards, focusing on actual adhesive joints' performance
  rather than on specific application of adhesive joints are necessary.
