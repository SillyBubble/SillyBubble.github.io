 abstract = {© 2019, © 2019 Taylor  &  Francis. The dissemination of composite materials introduces applications of hybrid structures with composite and metal parts. The development of reliable methodologies to evaluate the performance of these structures is required. In this work, the mixed-mode fracture behaviour of a bi-material adhesively bonded joint is investigated. A new strain-based criterion for the design of the mixed-mode bending (MMB) bi-material specimen is suggested. A new analytical partitioning method based on the ‘global method' is proposed and tested on a composite-to-metal bonded joint and compared with a finite element model using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The results show that the proposed strain-based design methodology can be successfully used in MMB test for bi-material joints. The fracture mode partitioning is accurately predicted by the analytical method. However, the absolute values of the strain energy release rate (SERR) predicted by the analytical method are only accurate if the shear deformation in the test is not significant.},
