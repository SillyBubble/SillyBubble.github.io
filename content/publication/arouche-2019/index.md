abstract: © 2019, © 2019 Taylor  &  Francis. The dissemination of composite materials
  introduces applications of hybrid structures with composite and metal parts. The
  development of reliable methodologies to evaluate the performance of these structures
  is required. In this work, the mixed-mode fracture behaviour of a bi-material adhesively
  bonded joint is investigated. A new strain-based criterion for the design of the
  mixed-mode bending (MMB) bi-material specimen is suggested. A new analytical partitioning
  method based on the ‘global method' is proposed and tested on a composite-to-metal
  bonded joint and compared with a finite element model using the virtual crack closure
  technique (VCCT). The results show that the proposed strain-based design methodology
  can be successfully used in MMB test for bi-material joints. The fracture mode partitioning
  is accurately predicted by the analytical method. However, the absolute values of
  the strain energy release rate (SERR) predicted by the analytical method are only
  accurate if the shear deformation in the test is not significant.
