 abstract = {Adhesive bonding is one of the most promising joining technologies for composite aircraft. However, to comply with current aircraft certification rules, current safety-critical bonded joints, in which at least one of the interfaces requires additional surface preparation, are always used in combination with redundant mechanical fasteners, such as rivets and bolts. This lack of trust in bonded structures is mostly linked to the fear of lack of adhesion or a “weak bond”. The aim of this paper is to tackle this challenge by assessing the ability to use composite peel tests and acoustic emission (AE) technique to assess adhesion quality and distinguish a good bond quality from a “weak bond”. Composite Bell Peel (CBP) tests and Double-Cantilever-Beam (DCB) tests were performed on contaminated and non-contaminated CFRP bonded specimens. The results show that peel strength drops significantly at the location of the contaminated interface that has led to weak adhesion, as a result from adhesive failure. The AE signals obtained during DCB tests show different features for cracks growing at the interface (“weak bonds”) and inside the adhesive layer (cohesive failure). In addition to this, scattering of the AE signals were observed in the contaminated specimens with “weak bonds”.},
