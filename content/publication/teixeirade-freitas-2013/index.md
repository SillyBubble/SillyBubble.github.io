abstract: The strengthening systems studied consist of bonding a second steel plate
  to the existing orthotropic bridge deck, either by using a 2. mm thick epoxy adhesive
  layer (bonded system) or a 15-30. mm thick polyurethane core (sandwich system).
  The aim of applying the reinforcement is to reduce the stresses at the deck and
  extend the fatigue life of orthotropic bridge decks. Three and four point bending
  fatigue tests were carried out on beam type specimens representing the reinforced
  deck. Linear elastic simulations using FEA were performed to determine the stress
  distribution during tests. Results show that the fatigue damage of the reinforcements
  are caused by the shear stresses at the adhesive layer, for the bonded system, and
  by the shear stresses at the faces-to-core interface, for the sandwich system. The
  fatigue strength of the bonded system is not significantly affected by adhesive
  thicknesses between 1 and 3. mm. The same can be found for the sandwich system with
  15. mm and 30. mm polyurethane-core thickness. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
