abstract: This work investigates the effect of long-term environmental exposure on
  the performance of composite-to-metal bonded joints. Specimens are manufactured
  using a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) co-bonded to a steel member with
  epoxy adhesive and aged in a salt spray chamber. The mixed-mode fracture behavior
  of the non-aged and aged specimens is assessed using the mixed-mode bending (MMB)
  test apparatus. The fracture energy is calculated using the finite elements method
  and an analytical approach, the strain-based method (SBM). The SBM showed to be
  a simple and accurate method to obtain the total fracture energy and the fracture
  mode ratio of the bi-material specimen. Ageing increased the fracture toughness
  at crack initiation by 27% for specimens loaded at 20% mode II and 7% for specimens
  loaded at 15% mode II. This can be related to the shear behavior and plasticization
  of the adhesive material. During crack propagation, the fracture toughness remained
  similar for specimens loaded at 20% mode II and decreased by 15% in specimens loaded
  at 15% mode II. Fractography analysis together with chemical characterization showed
  that the penetration of moisture at the edges of the fracture surface produced adhesive
  failure in these regions affected by moisture. Moreover, the failure mode at the
  unaffected regions of the fracture surface shifted from cohesive to a combination
  of thin-layer cohesive and adhesive failure after ageing. The results contributed
  to describe the effect of ageing on the fracture behavior of bonded materials.
