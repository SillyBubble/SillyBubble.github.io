abstract: Further deployment of advanced polymer-based composites in critical structures
  requires, among others, new progress in adhesive bonding solutions from processing
  to performance. Among others, the cost and time intensity of manufacturing can be
  mitigated through co-curing of composite elements using a thermoplastic film, typically
  a Polyetherimide (PEI) film. However, the use of PEI films in resin transfer moulding
  leads to low toughness (textless500 J/m2). The objective of this work is to improve
  the toughness of co-cured composite joints by inserting UHMPE filaments between
  a PEI film and the composite panels in order to trigger crack bridging and a significant
  R-effect. The influence of the spacing and of the tensile strength of the filaments
  has been determined experimentally, resulting in an increase of the toughness by
  up to a factor 3. In addition, the influence of these parameters has been further
  investigated with a closed-form crack propagation model. Decreasing the spacing
  and increasing the strength of the filaments enhances the joint toughness. Increasing
  the tensile elongation of the filaments results in a less steep R-effect, requiring
  a longer crack propagation to attain of the maximum fracture toughness.
