abstract: This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of the ultrasonic welding process
  for joining epoxy- to thermoplastic-based composites sensitivity to the heating
  time. For that, carbon fibre (CF)/epoxy adherends with a co-cured PEI coupling layer
  were ultrasonically welded to CF/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) adherends at different
  heating times. Process-induced changes in the meso and microstructure of these welds
  were identified and correlated to the weld strength. Subsequently, a processing
  interval, i.e., a range of heating times resulting in less than 10% decrease of
  weld strength, was defined. As, expected, the dissimilar composite welded joints
  were more sensitive to the heating time than the CF/PEEK to CF/PEEK welded joints.
  However, this effect was less pronounced than expected, since a relatively wide
  processing interval could be obtained provided that the coupling layer had a sufficient
  thickness.
