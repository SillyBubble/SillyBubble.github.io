 abstract = {This study aims at assessing the sensitivity of the ultrasonic welding process for joining epoxy- to thermoplastic-based composites sensitivity to the heating time. For that, carbon fibre (CF)/epoxy adherends with a co-cured PEI coupling layer were ultrasonically welded to CF/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) adherends at different heating times. Process-induced changes in the meso and microstructure of these welds were identified and correlated to the weld strength. Subsequently, a processing interval, i.e., a range of heating times resulting in less than 10% decrease of weld strength, was defined. As, expected, the dissimilar composite welded joints were more sensitive to the heating time than the CF/PEEK to CF/PEEK welded joints. However, this effect was less pronounced than expected, since a relatively wide processing interval could be obtained provided that the coupling layer had a sufficient thickness.},
