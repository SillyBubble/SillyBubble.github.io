abstract: This paper presents a new process for obtaining eco-epoxide adhesives synthesized
  from bio-renewable raw material (tannic acid-TA) and used for bonding lightweight
  materials (aluminum (Al) and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Two synthesized
  bio-epoxy components based on TA, (A) glycidyl ether and (B) glycidyl phosphate
  ester of TA, were used as a replacement for the toxic epoxy component based on Bisphenol
  A. The effect of eco-epoxy components on the interface adhesion was measured by
  the determination of adhesion parameter b, which was compared to the reference epoxy
  (REF). The increase of adhesion parameter b was 77.5% for A and 151.5% for B. The
  adhesion of both eco-adhesives was tested using the bell peel test (BPT) with the
  Al and CFRP adherends. When compared to REF, the average peel load for B was 17.6%
  (39.3%) and 58.3% (176.9%) higher for the Al and CFRP adherends, respectively. Complete
  adhesion failure of REF reflected the weak adhesion to both Al and CFRP, which was
  improved by the addition of eco-epoxy components A and B showing the presence of
  cohesive failure. The microhardness testing method of interface adhesion was proven
  to be a fast and reliable testing method, providing a qualitative indication in
  adhesive selection.
