abstract: 'Two systems for reinforcing orthotropic bridge deck (OBD) have been researched:
  the bonded steel plates system and the sandwich steel plates system. The main idea
  of these type of reinforcement is to stiffen the existing deck plate, thereby reducing
  the stresses at the fatigue sensitive details, and thus extending the fatigue life
  of the OBD. Both reinforcement systems consist of adding a second steel plate to
  the existing steel deck. The behaviour and the effect of the reinforcement systems
  on full-scale OBD are investigated. Full-scale static tests and finite element analyses
  were performed on the reinforced deck panels, using realistic wheel loads. The results
  showed at least 40% of stress reduction close to the fatigue sensitive details after
  applying both reinforcements. The two suggested reinforcement systems showed a good
  performance and proved to be efficient lightweight solutions to refurbish orthotropic
  bridge decks and extend their life span.'
