abstract: An essential question to predict the structural integrity of bi-material
  bonded joints is how to obtain their fracture properties under pure mode I. From
  open literature, it is found that the most commonly used design criterion to test
  mode I fracture is matching the flexural stiffnesses of the two adherents in a DCB
  coupon. However, the material asymmetry in such designed joints results in mode
  II fracture as well. In this paper, a new design criterion is proposed to obtain
  pure mode I fracture in adhesively bonded bi-material DCB joints by matching the
  longitudinal strain distributions of the two adherends at the bondline - longitudinal
  strain based criterion. A test program and Finite Element modelling have been carried
  out to verify the proposed design criterion using composite-metal bonded DCB joints.
  Both the experimental and numerical results show that pure mode I can be achieved
  in bi-material joints designed with the proposed criterion. GII/GI ratio is reduced
  by a factor of 5 when using the proposed longitudinal strain based criterion in
  comparison with the flexural stiffness based criterion.
