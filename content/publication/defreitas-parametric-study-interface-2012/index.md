abstract: 'The article presents renovation solutions for orthotropic steel bridge
  decks consisting of bonding a second steel plate to the existing steel deck in order
  to reduce the stresses and enlarge the life span of the orthotropic bridge deck.
  Two solutions for the interface layer between the existing deck plate and the second
  steel plate are presented: thin epoxy (bonded system) and thick polyurethane (sandwich
  system). A parametric study based on analytical solutions is carried out on flexural
  behavior of beams representing the renovation solutions. The influence of geometrical,
  mechanical and structural parameters on the stiffness and stress reduction factor
  of the system is studied. Maximum values of stiffness and stress reduction are achieved
  when maximizing the interface layer thickness and minimizing the second steel plate
  thickness with in certain practical limits. Based on the weight restrictions one
  can choose the most efficient interface layer regarding thickness and mechanical
  properties.'
