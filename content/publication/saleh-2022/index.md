abstract: "Thicker bondlines along with manufacturing-tolerant and fracture-resistant
  adhesives are trends visible across different industries, especially maritime. In
  this work, two contrasting adhesives: an elastic-brittle epoxy-based, and a nonlinear-ductile
  methyl methacrylate (MMA) are characterized and compared via tensile, compact tension
  (CT) and double cantilever beam (DCB) testing, for steel-to-steel adherends. Significant
  differences are captured between the two bonding materials in terms of the energy
  required for crack growth: in the MMA “ductile” adhesive is ∼4 and 10 times more
  than for the epoxy “relatively brittle” adhesive for CT and DCB testing, respectively.
  While epoxy bondlines fail due to a symmetric in-plane crack, the MMA bondlines
  experience multiple cracking originating from high deformations and Poisson's effects.
  Moreover, in the case of MMA adhesive, the DCB testing led to plastic deformation
  of steel adherends. The existing evaluation protocols are adopted for data reduction
  and the effect of plastic dissipation is theoretically addressed. Despite adherend
  plasticity, it is concluded that the crack growth is driven by the elastic energy
  release, and thus, after small correction taking into account initial adherend plasticity,
  the existing simple models can still be used. This study highlights the potential
  use of ductile adhesive instead of the commonly used brittle ones to significantly
  improve the adhesively bonded joints in maritime applications in which thick bondlines,
  manufacturing-tolerant and fracture-resistance characteristics are required."
