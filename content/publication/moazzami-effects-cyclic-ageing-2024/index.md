abstract: In marine structures adhesive joint structures are often exposed to cyclic
  conditioning where the ambient humidity changes cyclically during their service.
  Though some comprehensive studies on the aging of adhesives exist, these researches
  mainly focus on monotonic aging conditions where the adhesive joints are exposed
  to a wet condition continuously for a long time. However, the few investigations
  performed on the cyclic moisture absorption of adhesive materials show that the
  parameters obtained in monotonic aging conditions are not suitable for estimation
  of the aging behaviour of adhesive exposed to alternating humidity. An important
  question that can arise is whether or not this frequency affects the mechanical
  behaviour of adhesive joints under cyclic aging condition. In this investigation
  bulk dogbone and square samples were manufactured, subjected to cyclic aging conditions
  with four different aging frequencies and tested. The results show that the moisture
  diffusion constant of adhesives exposed to higher aging frequencies increase more
  than those exposed to lower aging frequency conditions. In addition, the moisture
  content only affects the degradation of strength and stiffness of the tested adhesives
  in different aging frequencies.
