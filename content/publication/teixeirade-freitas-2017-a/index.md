abstract: Â© 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. Full-scale fatigue tests were
  performed on two retrofitted orthotropic bridge decks (OBDs). The retrofitting systems
  consist of adding a second steel plate on the top of the existing deck. The aim
  is to reduce the stresses at the fatigue-sensitive details and therefore extend
  the fatigue life of the OBD by stiffening the existing deck plate. Two retrofitting
  systems were studied. The bonded system consists of bonding a second steel plate
  to the existing deck by vacuum infusing a thin adhesive layer (2 mm) between the
  two steel plates. The sandwich system consists of bonding the second steel plate
  through a thick polyurethane core (15 mm). The aim of the study was to assess the
  fatigue performance of both retrofittings. No fatigue damage was detected in the
  retrofitting layers during fatigue tests after three million cycles of wheel load.
  The stresses close to the deck-plate-to-stiffener welds decreased by at least 55%
  when using the bonded steel plates system and 45% when using the sandwich steel
  plates system. Both systems proved to have sufficient fatigue life to withstand
  traffic wheel loads running on orthotropic bridge decks and help extend the fatigue
  life of the existing OBD.
