abstract: Ultrasonic welding is a highly promising technique for joining thermoplastic
  to thermoset composites. A neat thermoplastic coupling layer is co-cured on the
  surface to be welded to make the thermoset composite ‘weldable'. A reliable bond
  is attained when miscible thermoplastic and thermoset materials are chosen. For
  welding carbon fibre/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) to thermoset composite samples,
  a PEEK film is not preferable due to its immiscibility with epoxy resins. On the
  other hand, polyetherimide is an excellent candidate, since it is known to be miscible
  to most epoxy systems at high temperatures and PEEK polymers. This study focusses
  on two main subjects; firstly, the nature of the material of the energy director,
  i.e. a flat thermoplastic film used to promote heat generation at the interface.
  In this case, the energy director can be either polyetherimide, as in the coupling
  layer or PEEK material, as in the matrix of the thermoplastic composite adherend.
  It was found that both materials can produce welds with similar mechanical performance.
  This study focusses secondly on the thickness of the coupling layer. Due to the
  high melting temperature of the PEEK matrix, a 60-µm-thick coupling layer was seemingly
  too thin to act as a thermal barrier for the epoxy resin for heating times long
  enough to produce fully welded joints. Such an issue was found to be overcome by
  increasing the thickness of the coupling layer to 250 µm, which resulted in high-strength
  welds.
