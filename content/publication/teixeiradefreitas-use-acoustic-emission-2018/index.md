abstract: Adhesive bonding is one of the most promising joining technologies for composite
  aircraft. However, to comply with current aircraft certification rules, current
  safety-critical bonded joints, in which at least one of the interfaces requires
  additional surface preparation, are always used in combination with redundant mechanical
  fasteners, such as rivets and bolts. This lack of trust in bonded structures is
  mostly linked to the fear of lack of adhesion or a ``weak bond''.
