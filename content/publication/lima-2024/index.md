abstract: This study uses the acoustic emission structural health monitoring method
  to identify fracture mechanisms in composite bonded joints when varying the substrate
  stacking sequence. Quasi-static mode I loading tests were performed on secondary
  adhesively bonded multidirectional composite substrates (0, 90, 45, −45, 60 and
  −60° fibre orientations). An unsupervised artificial neural network combined with
  the visual fracture evaluation of the specimens and the Morlet continuous wavelet
  transform was used to cluster and give the acoustic emission signals a physical
  meaning. Different fracture mechanisms could be identified within the adhesive layer
  (i.e., cohesive failure) and in the composite substrates, including non-visible
  damage mechanisms (matrix micro-cracking, fibre/matrix debonding, fibre pull-out
  and fibre breakage). Using the Morlet continuous wavelet transform, it was possible
  to recognise that the highest peak frequency does not always represent the most
  relevant signature of the fracture mechanism. Moreover, multiple peak frequencies
  can be associated with multiple fracture mechanisms, such as the fibre pull-out
  that occurs in the combination of matrix cracking and fibre breakage. Furthermore,
  no differences were observed in mode I loading conditions between the acoustic emission
  signatures from the cohesive failure in the adhesive layer and the matrix cracking
  within the composite substrate. The findings of this study present a great opportunity
  to gain more insight into the fracture behaviour of polymer materials and fibre-reinforced
  polymer materials and to improve the quality of adhesively bonded joints.
