abstract: 'Spider silk is known for its excellent strength and fracture resistance
  properties due to its molecular design structure, characterized by sacrificial bonds
  and hidden lengths. These structures have inspired reinforcements of synthetic polymer
  materials to enhance toughness. In this study, we mimic these natural toughening
  mechanisms by designing and manufacturing 3D-printed polymeric structures incorporating
  overlapping curls consisting of coiling fiber with sacrificial bonds and hidden
  lengths. Utilizing the liquid rope coiling effect, we manufactured overlapping curls
  using three polymers: polylactic acid (PLA), liquid crystal polymer (LCP), and polyamide
  6 (PA6). Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical properties
  of overlapping curl as a function of geometries, post-treatments, and material constitutive
  parameters. Our results show that single-sided overlapping curls can fully unfold
  while double-sided curls are prone to premature failure. Heat-pressure post-treatment
  was found to significantly increase the load-capacity of the sacrificial bonds by
  up to Image 1 due to increased contact area. However, the defects introduced in
  the fibre after the break of the sacrificial bonds, make the structure more susceptible
  to premature failure, limit the complete unfolding of the hidden length, and lead
  to a decrease up to Image 2 of the toughness. To guarantee the complete unfolding
  of the hidden lengths and improve the toughness, we demonstrate that selecting a
  polymer material with either high fracture strength (e.g., LCP, Image 3) or high
  fracture strain (e.g., PA6, $>$2) is crucial, and increase toughness up to Image
  4 and Image 5, respectively.'
