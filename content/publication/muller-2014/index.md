abstract: The positive features of fiber metal laminates such as Glare lead to innovative
  applications. Positive features of Glare are e.g. a lower fatigue crack growing
  rate compared to monolithic Aluminum, better UV- And moisture-resistance compared
  to pure glass fiber laminates and good bearing strengths in combination with favorable
  impact and lightening resistance. Although, a lot of studies have been made, the
  thermal diffusion and temperature distribution at moderate temperatures of Glare
  have not been investigated in such detail. Therefore, this study investigated the
  temperature distributions of different Glare laminates during heating to moderate
  temperatures. The heating was realized by means of a local circular heat source
  at a horizontally positioned specimen. The temperature distributions at the top
  and bottom surfaces of the specimen were measured by means of thermo couples and
  at the top side by means of an infrared camera. The temperatures were evaluated
  at different positions and plotted as a function of time and after the initial heating
  phase. The test results showed that both, the thermo couples and the infrared camera
  measured similar temperatures at the top surface. Furthermore, the effect of the
  orthotropic material behavior of the prepreg layers was not visible in the in-plane-temperature
  distributions. The results showed as well, that a higher number of prepreg layers
  reduce the out-of-plane heat flux and thicker Aluminum layers cause higher temperatures
  at the bottom surfaces. Furthermore, it was concluded that the distance from the
  specimen center where the temperature of the top and bottom surfaces become similar
  are a function of the layup.
