abstract: © 2019 Elsevier Ltd In ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites an
  energy director (ED) (i.e. neat thermoplastic film), is used between the two adherends
  to be welded, to promote frictional and viscoelastic heating. For welding of thermoset
  composites (TSC), a thermoplastic coupling layer is co-cured on the surface to be
  welded as typical procedure to make the TSC “weldable”. This study focuses on investigating
  whether a polyetherimide (PEI) coupling layer by itself has the potential to promote
  heat generation during ultrasonic welding of CF/epoxy and CF/PEI samples, without
  the need for a separate ED, and if so, what thickness should that coupling layer
  be. The main findings were that welding without a loose ED resulted in overheating
  of the CF/PEI adherend and/or coupling layer due to the inability of the latter
  to promote heat generation efficiently. However, welding of CF/epoxy and CF/PEI
  samples with the use of a loose ED resulted in high-strength welds.
