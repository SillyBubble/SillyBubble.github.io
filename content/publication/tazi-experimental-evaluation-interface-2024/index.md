abstract: Using fiber-reinforced composite patches for repairing damaged structures
  made of metal or/and concrete is an interesting and widely available solution on
  the market using synthetic materials. These repairing patches are bonded on the
  structures' surfaces to increase their strength against internal stresses, as well
  as protect them from external physico-chemical attacks, thereby limiting crack propagation.
  Natural fibers offer a potential alternative to replacing glass or carbon fibers
  commonly used for bonded repair patches. Similarly, bio-based polymers represent
  an important sustainable alternative for partially or entirely replacing the petroleum-based
  polymers. In this study, an epoxy matrix reinforced with flax fiber is proposed
  as the material for the patches, and bonded to a steel plate using four different
  types of adhesive materials, including a castor-oil derived polyurethane resin.
  Floating roller peel tests were performed to assess the adhesion and viability of
  these new patches. The resulting peeling loads and fracture surface analysis are
  presented. Polyurethane demonstrates promising performance for epoxy-to-steel joints,
  but major improvements of the bio-based polyurethane application process and curing
  conditions may be necessary for its successful industrial implementation.
