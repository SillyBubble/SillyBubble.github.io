abstract: Mechanics of double-lap Steel-to-CFRP adhesively-bonded joints loaded in
  tension are investigated experimentally using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and
  Acoustic Emission (AE), analytically using a one-dimensional closed-form solution
  and numerically with Finite Element analysis. The double-lap bi-material joints
  are fabricated of a steel core adhesively bonded to two CFRP skins with adhesive
  thickness of $âˆ¼$ 8 mm, using an Epoxy-based and MMA-based adhesives. In order to
  capture the in-plane deformation of the joint, full field strain/displacement maps
  are obtained using DIC. This data is used to validate the shear-lag model predictions
  of the adhesive shear stress/strain distribution as well as the linear-elastic Finite
  Element Model (FEM) results. In addition, they are used to capture the susceptible
  damage locations and their effect on the displacement contour maps, strain distribution
  and load transfer between the joint's different constituents. A correlation between
  the DIC displacement and the AE signals is obtained for damage detection in both
  joints. Moreover, a good agreement amongst the analytical, FE and DIC strain/stress
  distributions along the bond-line is observed. This study introduces the analytical
  shear-lag model as an alternative to predict the stress state in thick-adhesive
  double-lap joints, with an acceptable level of accuracy and robustness.
