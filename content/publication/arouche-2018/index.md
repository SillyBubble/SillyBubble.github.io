abstract: © 2018, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering. In
  this work, an experimental study has been carried out to evaluate the effect of
  salt water condition on the long-term adhesion of composite-to-metal bonded joints
  using peel tests. A new test configuration is tested via fully and partially immersed
  specimens with 500 mm length. Fracture surfaces of non-aged samples exhibited a
  cohesive failure within the adhesive layer, which indicates a good adhesion of the
  joint. Results revealed a significant difference in the interface adhesion between
  aged and non-aged condition after 150 days of immersion. Partially immersed specimens
  allow to evaluate the adhesion performance of the joint under dry and wet condition
  i n single specimen using a simple peel test.
