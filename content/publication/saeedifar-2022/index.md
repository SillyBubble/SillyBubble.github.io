abstract: This study is devoted to the use of acoustic emission technique for a comprehensive
  damage assessment, that is, damage detection, localization, and classification,
  of an aeronautical metal-to-composite bonded panel. The structure comprised a titanium
  panel adhesively bonded to carbon fiber–reinforced plastic omega stringers. The
  panel contained a small initial artificial debonding between the titanium panel
  and one of the carbon fiber–reinforced plastic stringers. The panel was subjected
  to a cyclic increasing in-plane compression load, including loading, unloading,
  and then reloading to a higher load level, until the final fracture. The generated
  acoustic emission signals were captured by the acoustic emission sensors, and digital
  image correlation was also used to obtain the strain field on the surface of the
  panel during the test. The results showed that acoustic emission can accurately
  detect the damage onset, localize it, and also trace its evolution. The acoustic
  emission results not only were consistent with the digital image correlation results,
  but also managed to detect the damage initiation earlier than digital image correlation.
  Finally, the acoustic emission signals were clustered using particle swarm optimization
  method to identify the different damage mechanisms. The results of this study demonstrate
  the capability of acoustic emission for the comprehensive damage characterization
  of aeronautical bi-material adhesively bonded structures.
