abstract: This paper addresses the sensitivity of the ultrasonic welding process for
  joining dissimilar composites to variations in either the welding force or amplitude
  of vibrations. For that, carbon fibre (CF)/epoxy specimens were welded to CF/polyetheretherketone
  (PEEK) specimens, through a polyetheretherimide (PEI) coupling layer co-cured with
  the CF/epoxy material. It was found that reducing either the welding force or the
  amplitude of vibrations caused an increase in the heating time and maximum temperatures
  between the coupling layer and CF/epoxy adherend. In addition, local signs of thermal
  degradation were found in the CF/epoxy adherend even at welding conditions that
  resulted in the highest strength. However, such alterations were not significant
  enough to have an apparent effect on the maximum lap shear strength of the welded
  joints.
