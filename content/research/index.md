        **Tailoring Composite Substrates**
        <br />
        @Técnico @TU Delft
        <br />

        Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and improve sustainability in the aeronautical sector have been increasing, leading to new solutions to **extend aircraft’s operational life and reuse of multi-material and composite components**. Furthermore, the industry is striving towards more efficient, sustainable, and lightweight aircraft. However, one of the **challenges that needs to be tackled is the assembly and repair of advanced material components** in primary structures.
        
        This project aims to enhance the damage tolerance of secondary adhesively bonded joints by architecting their CFRP layups and exploring the effects of adhesives with different fracture toughness.

        **Biomimetic Toughening Structures**
        <br />
        @TU Delft
        <br />

        Climate change is a major global issue that impacts both the environment and human society, requiring an immediate effort to enhance sustainability in the mobility and energy sectors. Adhesive joints of lightweight composite structures offer great potential for more efficient and environmentally friendly designs, but ensuring their safety and reliability remains a major challenge.
        
        Drawing inspiration from the molecular design of spider silk, the project explores **3D-printed polymeric structures that incorporate sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths**. When embedded in polymer resins, these overlapping curl structures enhance the toughness of layered materials and create a supporting framework that enables alternative load paths, paving the way for safer and more sustainable lightweight structures.

        **Metal-to-composite Interfaces**
        <br />
        @TU Delft
        <br />

        Aerospace and automotive industries are under increasing pressure to reduce product weight in response to strict environmental regulations and the demand for lower operational costs. Adhesively bonded lightweight composites offer a promising route toward more efficient and sustainable designs. However, their safe and reliable application remains a key challenge.
        
        This project develops innovative methods for fracture characterization of bi-material bonded joints, with a particular focus on **metal-to-polymer interfaces**. By uncovering the underlying interfacial mechanisms, the research supports the reliable integration of composites with conventional metal-based structures, enabling stronger, lighter, and more sustainable engineering solutions.
