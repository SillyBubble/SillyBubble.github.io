<!-- Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->

**Organized by:**

- Dr. Xi Li - Department of Aerospace Science and Technology, Politecnico di Milano (Italy)

- Dr. Ioannis Kastivalis - Department of Architecture & Civil Engineering, University of Bath (UK)

- [Dr. Rosemere de Araujo Alves Lima](/author/rosemere-de-araujo-alves-lima/) - IDMEC - Instituto Superior Técnico, Lisboa (Portugal)

We are looking for high-impact contributions showcasing innovations that bring **composites closer to real-world, carbon-neutral applications**.


We welcome **experimental and computational studies** addressing concepts, methods, and applications related to (but not limited to):

- **Multifunctional design approaches**: composite materials and structures with integrated sensing, healing, energy storage, adaptive, and shape-memory capabilities.

- **Diagnostics and structural health monitoring**: in-situ methods, non-destructive evaluation, and data-driven damage detection.

If your work aligns with these topics, we'd love to see your contribution in our session! See you at the upcoming ECCM22 - 21-25 June 2026, Oslo, Norway!
