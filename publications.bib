The aim is to unfold the damage accumulation process, understand the interaction between different damage mechanisms, and quantify their contribution to stiffness degradation. Tension-tension fatigue tests were performed, while edge observation and DIC technique monitored the damage evolution. It was found that different accumulation process and interactive levels between transverse matrix cracks and delamination exist for specimens with similar stiffness degradation. A linear increase of stiffness degradation was observed with the increase of matrix crack density, while the growing trend of stiffness degradation converged with the increase of delamination.},

abstract = {Aiming to increase damage tolerance of adhesively bonded joints, this work explores the influence of CFRP layup of the adherends on the crack onset and crack propagation of composite bonded joints under mode I loading. Quasi-static Double Cantilever Beam tests were performed using four different CFRP layups bonded with two adhesives. Parallel to the experimental program, finite element analyses were performed to aid in understanding and identifying the various damage mechanisms in each specimen type. The results show that the CFRP layup and adhesive fracture toughness significantly influence the joint fracture phenomena at crack onset and further crack propagation. An enhancement of the joint's mode I fracture toughness values at crack onset was observed in the specimens where a crack competition between the propagation within the bondline and the composite's layers was triggered. During crack propagation, the fracture toughness of the joint increases at crack deflections between the different plies of the CFRP layup until reaching the 0° ply, where sudden delamination occurs. It has been shown that CFRP layup tailoring is a promising toughening method that, when carefully designed, has the potential to increase the maximum effective fracture toughness up to 100% when compared to pure cohesive failure.},

abstract = {Thermoset composites can be made “weldable” by co-curing a neat thermoplastic coupling layer on the surface to be welded. With its exceptionally short heating times, ultrasonic welding is a highly promising technique for joining advanced thermoplastic (TPC) to thermoset (TSC) composites, since it can potentially prevent thermal degradation of the thermoset adherend. Previous research has shown successful results on ultrasonic welding of carbon fibre (CF)/epoxy and TPC using a PEI coupling layer. However, it is still not clear what the processing window is for ultrasonic welding of TSC to TPC, i.e. how much flexibility we have in choosing the process parameters while maintaining good weld strength. Hence, knowing the mechanisms that cause a reduction in weld strength is of great importance for the optimization of ultrasonic welding of dissimilar composites. On top of that, it is important to determine how the thickness of the coupling layer affects the span of the processing window, since precious research has shown that the thickness of the coupling layer affects the welding process and the weld strength. Thus, in this study, a processing window for welding CF/epoxy and CF/PEEK composites (i.e. hybrid welds) was defined and compared to the processing window for ultrasonic welding of CF/PEEK samples (i.e. reference welds). Samples were welded at different displacements of the sonotrode, also known as travel, and the mechanical performance of each batch was determined by single-lap shear tests. Moreover, the effect of the thickness of the coupling layer on the processing window was determined by investigating three different thicknesses. It was concluded that the processing window span is increasing with an increasing coupling layer thickness. Furthermore, the processing window of the hybrid welds is narrower than the processing window of the reference welds.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic welding is a highly promising technique for joining thermoplastic to thermoset composites. A neat thermoplastic coupling layer is co-cured on the surface to be welded to make the thermoset composite ‘weldable'. A reliable bond is attained when miscible thermoplastic and thermoset materials are chosen. For welding carbon fibre/polyetheretherketone (PEEK) to thermoset composite samples, a PEEK film is not preferable due to its immiscibility with epoxy resins. On the other hand, polyetherimide is an excellent candidate, since it is known to be miscible to most epoxy systems at high temperatures and PEEK polymers. This study focusses on two main subjects; firstly, the nature of the material of the energy director, i.e. a flat thermoplastic film used to promote heat generation at the interface. In this case, the energy director can be either polyetherimide, as in the coupling layer or PEEK material, as in the matrix of the thermoplastic composite adherend. It was found that both materials can produce welds with similar mechanical performance. This study focusses secondly on the thickness of the coupling layer. Due to the high melting temperature of the PEEK matrix, a 60-µm-thick coupling layer was seemingly too thin to act as a thermal barrier for the epoxy resin for heating times long enough to produce fully welded joints. Such an issue was found to be overcome by increasing the thickness of the coupling layer to 250 µm, which resulted in high-strength welds.},

abstract = {Nowadays, dissimilar adhesive joints are used widely in different industrial sectors. For this type of joints, the investigation of the fracture behaviour under pure mode I loading is a vital issue. In order to study mode I fracture parameters of adhesive joints, scientists have proposed standard double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. In dissimilar DCB adhesive joints, because of material asymmetry, obtaining pure mode I is challenging. To obtain pure mode I loading in dissimilar DCB joints, scientists have proposed two criteria based on (1) the flexural stiffness and (2) the distribution of the longitudinal strain along the bondline. However, the achievement of pure mode I in dissimilar DCB joints needs more research. In this paper, the mode-mixity in dissimilar DCB joints designed based on the two mentioned criteria is investigated numerically and experimentally. Metal-composite DCBs were fabricated and tested. During the tensile tests, the horizontal and vertical displacement fields of the adhesive layer were calculated using digital image correlation (DIC) and the finite element method (FEM). Based on the obtained displacement fields and using Williams' series expansion, the mode-mixities were investigated. The results show that in order to achieve pure mode I loading in steel-composite joints, the criterion based on longitudinal strain is more suitable and in aluminium-composite joints the mode-mixities given by two criteria are almost the same.},

Single lap bonded joints with three different ply thicknesses of 200 $\mu$m, 100 $\mu$m and 50 $\mu$m were tested under quasi-static tensile loading. Acoustic Emission and Digital Image Correlation were used to monitor the damage and strain evolution of the overlap area during testing. 3D post-mortem failure analysis of the fracture surfaces were performed using a 3D profiling microscope. Experimental results show an increase of 16% in the lap shear strength and an increase of 21% in the strain energy when using the 50 $\mu$m instead of 200 $\mu$m ply thicknesses. However, Acoustic Emission measurements show that the damage initiation is postponed up to a 47% higher load when using 50 $\mu$m instead of 200 $\mu$m ply thicknesses. Moreover, the total amount of acoustic energy released from initiation up to final failure was significantly less with thin plies. A non-linear finite element analysis up to damage initiation indicates that with decreasing ply thickness, the damage onset inside the composite is postponed to higher loads and moves away from the adhesive interface towards the mid-thickness of the adherend. It is found that, decreasing the single ply thickness of laminated composite adherends in a single overlap bonded joint increases the maximum load and delays damage initiation of the joint, however the damage progression till final failure is more sudden.},

abstract = {Adhesive bonding is one of the most promising joining technologies for composite aircraft. However, to comply with current aircraft certification rules, current safety-critical bonded joints, in which at least one of the interfaces requires additional surface preparation, are always used in combination with redundant mechanical fasteners, such as rivets and bolts. This lack of trust in bonded structures is mostly linked to the fear of lack of adhesion or a “weak bond”. The aim of this paper is to tackle this challenge by assessing the ability to use composite peel tests and acoustic emission (AE) technique to assess adhesion quality and distinguish a good bond quality from a “weak bond”. Composite Bell Peel (CBP) tests and Double-Cantilever-Beam (DCB) tests were performed on contaminated and non-contaminated CFRP bonded specimens. The results show that peel strength drops significantly at the location of the contaminated interface that has led to weak adhesion, as a result from adhesive failure. The AE signals obtained during DCB tests show different features for cracks growing at the interface (“weak bonds”) and inside the adhesive layer (cohesive failure). In addition to this, scattering of the AE signals were observed in the contaminated specimens with “weak bonds”.},

This review article presents the commonly used experimental methods for the investigation of mechanical performance of adhesively bonded joints in the aerospace, wind energy, automotive and civil engineering sectors. In these sectors, due to their excellent intrinsic properties, composite materials are often used along with conventional materials such as steel, concrete and aluminium. In this context, and due to the limitations that the traditional joining techniques present, adhesive joints are an excellent alternative. However, standardized experimental procedures are not always applicable for testing representative adhesive joints in these industries. Lack of relevant regulations across the different fields is often overcome by the academia and companies' own regulations and standards. Additional costs are thus mitigated to the industrial sectors in relation with the certification process which effectively can deprive even the biggest companies from promoting adhesive bonding. To ensure continuous growth of the adhesive bonding field the new international standards, focusing on actual adhesive joints' performance rather than on specific application of adhesive joints are necessary.},

This test is inspired on the standard floating roller peel test widely used for metal bonding. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of the Composite Peel Test to assess interface adhesion in composite bonded structures. To this end, peel tests were performed with nine different types of adhesives and at two environmental temperatures, room temperature and +80°C. The results were compared with the standard floating roller peel tests with Aluminium adherends. The results show that when using the Composite Peel Test good interface adhesion results either in cohesive failure of the adhesive or intra-laminar failure of the composite, while bad adhesion results in adhesive failure. In most cases of good interface adhesion, increasing the temperature favors cohesive failure of the adhesive in detriment of intra-laminar failure of the composite. Peel strengths can be used as a quality indicator of interface adhesion only if using exactly the same type of flexible adherend (peeling-off member). Nevertheless, if cohesive failure is the dominant failure mode, the comparison between adhesives' peel strength is consistent disregarding of the type of peel-off adherend. Composite Peel Tests are suitable to assess interface adhesion of composite bonded structures.},

One of the possible strengthening systems to enlarge the fatigue life of the existing decks consists of bonding a second steel plate to the existing deck. This renovation technique was for the first time applied on the orthotropic deck of the movable bridge Scharsterrijn. This article describes the results of the structural monitoring carried out to evaluate the short-term and long-term performance of the strengthening system. Static and dynamic controlled load tests were carried out using a calibrated truck. Strain history measurements were recorded continuously during 1 year from the normal traffic running on the bridge. The short-term measurements show significant decrease of the stress level at the bridge deck after the renovation, especially at the deck plate details. The stresses at the welds between the deck plate and the stiffener web reduce approximately 55% at the deck plate side and 35% at the stiffener web side. Due to this reduction, the fatigue life of these welds is expected to increase 11 times at the deck plate side and 3.6 times at the stiffener side. The long-term measurements do not show significant changes in the stress level at the bridge deck during the year of monitoring. The strengthening system has demonstrated good performance reliability to prolong the life span of the movable orthotropic bridges. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

The increasing use of Adhesively-bonded joints in industrial applications resulted in more attention to damage assessment in these joints. The aim of the present study is to characterize the damage in bi-material double-lap adhesively-bonded joints by Acoustic Emission (A E). Two different structural adhesives, representing a ductile (Methacrylate-based) and brittle (epoxy-based) types, were used to bond C F R P skins to a steel core. The fabricated joints were loaded in tension while damage evolution was monitored by A E . Due to the difference in the fracture nature of the adhesives "brittle vs. ductile", different damage mechanisms occurred in the specimens; including adhesive layer failure, steel deformation, adhesive/adherends interfacial debonding and delamination in the C F R P skin. In order to distinguish and classify these damage types by A E, the AE features of each damage mechanism were first obtained by conducting some standard tests on the individual constituent materials. Then, these AE reference patterns were used to train an ensemble decision tree classifier. Finally, the trained model classified the AE signals of the double-lap tests and the images captured by camera were utilized to verify AE results. This study demonstrates the potential of AE technique for damage characterization of the adhesively-bonded bi-material joints.},

In this work, the mixed-mode fracture behaviour of a bi-material adhesively bonded joint is investigated. A new strain-based criterion for the design of the mixed-mode bending (MMB) bi-material specimen is suggested. A new analytical partitioning method based on the ‘global method' is proposed and tested on a composite-to-metal bonded joint and compared with a finite element model using the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT). The results show that the proposed strain-based design methodology can be successfully used in MMB test for bi-material joints.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors A high-power UV-irradiation technique was proposed for the surface treatment of PPS and PEEK composites, aiming to achieve good adhesion with epoxy adhesives. The composite substrates were rapidly UV-irradiated for a duration of between 2–30s, and then bonded using an aerospace film adhesive to produce joints. Tensile lap-shear strength and mode-I and mode-II fracture energies of the adhesive joints were investigated. It was observed that the application of a short-time UV-irradiation to the substrates transformed the failure mode of the specimens from adhesion failure to substrate damage in all cases. This consequently resulted in remarkable improvements in the mechanical and fracture performance of the adhesive joints. For example, the lap-shear strength increased from 11.8MPa to 31.7MPa upon UV-irradiating the PPS composites for 3s, and from 8.3MPa to 37.3MPa by applying a 5s UV-irradiation to the PEEK composites. Moreover, the mode-I and mode-II fracture energies significantly increased from ∼50J/m2 to ∼1500J/m2 and from <300J/m2 to ∼7000J/m2, respectively for both of the adhesively bonded PEEK and PPS composite joints.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to study the self-healing capability of fractured Al joints bonded with novel eco-epoxide adhesives synthesized from a bio-renewable raw material (tannic acid – TA). Two synthesized eco-epoxy components based on TA, (A) glycidyl ether and (B) glycidyl phosphate ester of TA, were used as a replacement for the toxic epoxy component based on Bisphenol A. The effect of the eco-epoxy components on the self-healing capability was measured as a recovery of shear strength in a single lap joint (SLJ) test after complete failure, which was compared to the reference epoxy (R). The self-healing procedure was performed in an autoclave at 180 °C for 2 h and 2 bars. A combination of two monitoring techniques, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Acoustic Emission (AE), was used to monitor the strain distribution and damage propagation in the SLJ. The measured shear stress of A and B adhesives in the SLJ had values in the range of 2.3–5.1 MPa. A fracture analysis showed complete adhesive failure for all the tested adhesives, which was not affected by the self-healing process. Out of all adhesives, only the A adhesive demonstrated the capability to heal. The recovery of the shear strength for adhesive A was higher than 50% of the virgin case. In addition, the AE analysis managed to capture a clear distinction between the signals for the virgin and the self-healed tests for adhesive A. Results obtained in this study highlighted the promising potential of using bio-based epoxy adhesives in structural adhesive bonding with the possibility of using self-healing in the recovery of the strength of such bonded joints.},

An experimental program has been carried out aiming to better understand the sandwich beam flexural behavior. The temperature significantly affects the sandwich flexural behavior. Increase in the temperature decreases the sandwich stiffness and strength. The stiffness is more difficult to predict at high temperatures due to the viscoelastic behavior of the core. Stiffer and stronger renovation solutions can be achieved by putting the extra weight on the core thickness rather than on the faces thickness. Stresses on the deck plate can be reduced by 60-95% using this renovation system. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the adherend material on the mode I fracture behaviour of bi-material composite bonded joints. Both single-material (steel-steel and composite-composite) and bi-material (steel-composite) joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive are studied. Additionally, two adhesive bondline thicknesses are considered: 0.4 mm (thin bondline) and 10.1 mm (thick bondline). The Penado-Kanninen reduction scheme is applied to evaluate the mode I strain energy release rate. The results show that the mode I fracture energy, GIc, is independent of the adherend type and joint configuration (single or bi-material). GIc shows average values between 0.60 and 0.72 N/mm for thin bondlines and 0.90–1.10 N/mm for thick bondlines. For thin bondlines, the failure is cohesive and the similar degree of constraint that is imposed to the adhesive by the high-modulus (i.e., steel) and/or relatively thick (i.e., composite) adherends results in similar values of GIc for both single- and bi-material joint types. For thick bondlines, the crack grows closer to one of the adhesive-adherend interfaces, but still within the adhesive. The results show that the adhesive could deform similarly, although the crack has been constrained on one side by different types of adherends, either a steel or composite.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of fibre metal laminate panels adhesively bonded and cured using resistance heating. Three manufacturing processes are compared for different layups with an embedded steel mesh at the mid-plane: autoclave curing, resistance bonding of two (autoclave-cured) panels and complete out-of-autoclave resistance curing of panels. Interlaminar shear strength tests and optical microscopy analysis showed that resistance bonding is a promising technique, leading to results comparable to autoclave curing. Resistance curing led to an interlaminar shear strength decrease of 30–60%. A study of the correlation between degree of cure and distance from the mesh revealed the potential of resistance bonding to be used for flexible embedded mesh geometries and on-site repairs.},

Process-induced changes in the meso and microstructure of these welds were identified and correlated to the weld strength. Subsequently, a processing interval, i.e., a range of heating times resulting in less than 10% decrease of weld strength, was defined. As, expected, the dissimilar composite welded joints were more sensitive to the heating time than the CF/PEEK to CF/PEEK welded joints. However, this effect was less pronounced than expected, since a relatively wide processing interval could be obtained provided that the coupling layer had a sufficient thickness.},

abstract = {Thicker bondlines along with manufacturing-tolerant and fracture-resistant adhesives are trends visible across different industries, especially maritime. In this work, two contrasting adhesives: an elastic-brittle epoxy-based, and a nonlinear-ductile methyl methacrylate (MMA) are characterized and compared via tensile, compact tension (CT) and double cantilever beam (DCB) testing, for steel-to-steel adherends. Significant differences are captured between the two bonding materials in terms of the energy required for crack growth: in the MMA “ductile” adhesive is ∼4 and 10 times more than for the epoxy “relatively brittle” adhesive for CT and DCB testing, respectively. While epoxy bondlines fail due to a symmetric in-plane crack, the MMA bondlines experience multiple cracking originating from high deformations and Poisson's effects. Moreover, in the case of MMA adhesive, the DCB testing led to plastic deformation of steel adherends. The existing evaluation protocols are adopted for data reduction and the effect of plastic dissipation is theoretically addressed. Despite adherend plasticity, it is concluded that the crack growth is driven by the elastic energy release, and thus, after small correction taking into account initial adherend plasticity, the existing simple models can still be used. This study highlights the potential use of ductile adhesive instead of the commonly used brittle ones to significantly improve the adhesively bonded joints in maritime applications in which thick bondlines, manufacturing-tolerant and fracture-resistance characteristics are required.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to explore new topologies for adhesively bonded composite overlap joints in order to improve their strength under tensile loading. Multiple stacked overlaps, also referred as finger joints, are compared with single overlap topologies. The quasi-static tensile behaviour of single lap joints with two overlap lengths 12.7 mm and 25.4 mm are compared to finger joints with 1 and 2 stacked overlaps through thickness with constant 12.7 mm overlap length. Two composite adherend stacking sequences are tested for each topology [0/90]4s and [90/0]4s. A non-linear FE-analysis is performed to analyse the shear and peel stresses along the adhesive bond line. A difference in peak shear and peel stress, at the tip of the bonded region could be observed: (i) for 1 finger, the peak peel stress is higher than in the single lap joint configurations because the beneficial effect of avoiding eccentricity in the finger joint is outperformed by the detrimental effect of reducing to half the adherend stiffness at the overlap; (ii) for 2 fingers, the stress field changes significantly leads to a 23% decrease in peak shear and 33% in peak peel stress, compared to the single lap joint topologies. In addition, experimental lap shear tests are performed and monitored using acoustic emission technique, to follow the damage events. Different trends at damage initation and at maximum load are believed to result from how the damage propagates inside the joint. A topology with 2 fingers and layup [90/0]4s, which fails entirely inside the adherend, provides the lowest peak shear and peel stress and the highest load at damage initiation. It is however outperformed in maximum load by a single lap joint topology with layup [0/90]4s, with mostly cohesive failure. It is further found that, unlike in single overlap topologies, the most dominant stress component for damage initiation inside the finger joints is the in-plane tensile stress, at the butt joint resin pockets, rather than peel stresses at the overlap region. Lastly, if weight efficiency is the main requirement, a finger joint design can effectively replace a single overlap joint design. However, for absolute maximum joint strength, the single overlap joint is a better choice than the finger joint.},

The following aspects are observed and discussed: effect of the adhesive carrier film, non-smooth crack growth and rising R curve. An analytical model taking into account the aforementioned effects is proposed. The kissing bond leads to unstable crack growth resulting in a loss of the load carrying capacity. The presence of the knit carrier in the adhesive film results in the crack growth process characteristic for the stick-slip phenomena and a significant increase of the resistance to fracture of the bondline by triggering a bridging phenomenon. The model shows a very good agreement with the experimental data.

An empirical relation, in terms of geometrical and material properties of the joints, that defines the transition between non-cohesive and cohesive fracture onset is found. Above a specific pre-crack length the stress singularity at pre-crack tip rules over the stress singularity near bi-material corners, resulting in mid-adhesive thickness cohesive fracture onset.

abstract = {Steel-to-glass laminated connections, which have recently been developed, limit stress intensifications on the glass and combine strength and transparency. Transparent Structural Silicone Adhesive (TSSA) connections have been used in several projects worldwide; however, the hyperelastic and viscoelastic nature of the material has to date not been fully investigated. In this work, the first objective is to investigate the mechanical response of TSSA connections under static and cyclic loading by means of experimental tests. Firstly, the shear behaviour of TSSA circular connections is characterized by means of monotonic and cyclic loading tests. The adhesive exhibits significant stress-softening under repeated cycles that becomes more severe as the maximum load increases. Secondly, TSSA circular connections are subjected to monotonic and cyclic tensile loading of increasing maximum load. The way whitening propagates on the adhesive surface shows some consistency comparing the cases of static and cyclic loading. The second objective is to analytically describe the deformation behaviour of the adhesive based on hyperelastic prediction models. Uniaxial and biaxial tension tests are combined with the simple shear tests, for the material characterization of TSSA. The hyperelastic material parameters are calibrated by a simultaneous multi-experiment-data-fit based on the nonlinear least squares optimization method. The softening behaviour observed in shear tests is modeled based on a simplified pseudo-elastic damage model proposed by Ogden–Roxburgh. A first attempt is also made to model the actual softening response of the adhesive. A less conservative approach proposed by Guo, also based on the theory of pseudo-elasticity, proved to give a good approximation of the actual cyclic response of the adhesive.},

Positive features of Glare are e.g. a lower fatigue crack growing rate compared to monolithic Aluminum, better UV- And moisture-resistance compared to pure glass fiber laminates and good bearing strengths in combination with favorable impact and lightening resistance. Although, a lot of studies have been made, the thermal diffusion and temperature distribution at moderate temperatures of Glare have not been investigated in such detail. Therefore, this study investigated the temperature distributions of different Glare laminates during heating to moderate temperatures. The heating was realized by means of a local circular heat source at a horizontally positioned specimen. The temperature distributions at the top and bottom surfaces of the specimen were measured by means of thermo couples and at the top side by means of an infrared camera. The temperatures were evaluated at different positions and plotted as a function of time and after the initial heating phase. The test results showed that both, the thermo couples and the infrared camera measured similar temperatures at the top surface. Furthermore, the effect of the orthotropic material behavior of the prepreg layers was not visible in the in-plane-temperature distributions. The results showed as well, that a higher number of prepreg layers reduce the out-of-plane heat flux and thicker Aluminum layers cause higher temperatures at the bottom surfaces. Furthermore, it was concluded that the distance from the specimen center where the temperature of the top and bottom surfaces become similar are a function of the layup.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd In ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites an energy director (ED) (i.e. neat thermoplastic film), is used between the two adherends to be welded, to promote frictional and viscoelastic heating. For welding of thermoset composites (TSC), a thermoplastic coupling layer is co-cured on the surface to be welded as typical procedure to make the TSC “weldable”. This study focuses on investigating whether a polyetherimide (PEI) coupling layer by itself has the potential to promote heat generation during ultrasonic welding of CF/epoxy and CF/PEI samples, without the need for a separate ED, and if so, what thickness should that coupling layer be. The main findings were that welding without a loose ED resulted in overheating of the CF/PEI adherend and/or coupling layer due to the inability of the latter to promote heat generation efficiently. However, welding of CF/epoxy and CF/PEI samples with the use of a loose ED resulted in high-strength welds.},

Carbon-epoxy laminate specimens were immersed in a salt water tank for 60 days. Some specimens were then dried at room temperature for 280 days, until recovering their initial weight. Specimens were tested using the composite peel test, an adaptation of the floating roller peel tests for composite materials. The results showed a degradation of peel strength in some areas due to the ageing process. The drying process did not affect the test results. A scanning electron microscopic analysis carried out on the fracture surface of the specimens revealed a typical mode I failure microstructure. A mixture of matrix failure and fibre/matrix interfacial failure was observed in non-aged specimens. Finally, a chemical characterization of the fracture surfaces with energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the penetration of salt water in regions near the edge of the specimens. A degradation of the fibre/matrix interface adhesion was observed in affected areas.

The tests were performed according to the ASTM standard of floating roller peel tests with a new specimen layup. The layup and geometry of the specimen was defined in order to have the Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) and carbon steel as the rigid and flexible substrate, respectively. Specimens were exposed to salt spray (or salt fog) for 30 and 90 days. The results show that the adhesion performance (i.e. average peel load) of the joints progressively decreases with increasing the ageing time. The fracture surfaces of dry specimens (non-aged) exhibit a cohesive failure within the adhesive layer, which indicates a good adhesion between the CFRP-steel interfaces. Interface degradation is indicated by a drop in peel load and adhesive failure. The percentage of adhesive failure increases with ageing times. Fracture surfaces of the adhesive failure exhibit deposition of NaCl crystal at the interface. Peel test successfully assessed the interface adhesion in aged and non-aged conditions, and can be used as a fast, easy and reliable test to study the long term durability in case of composite-metal bonded joints.},

abstract = {An essential question to predict the structural integrity of bi-material bonded joints is how to obtain their fracture properties under pure mode I. From open literature, it is found that the most commonly used design criterion to test mode I fracture is matching the flexural stiffnesses of the two adherents in a DCB coupon. However, the material asymmetry in such designed joints results in mode II fracture as well. In this paper, a new design criterion is proposed to obtain pure mode I fracture in adhesively bonded bi-material DCB joints by matching the longitudinal strain distributions of the two adherends at the bondline - longitudinal strain based criterion. A test program and Finite Element modelling have been carried out to verify the proposed design criterion using composite-metal bonded DCB joints. Both the experimental and numerical results show that pure mode I can be achieved in bi-material joints designed with the proposed criterion. GII/GI ratio is reduced by a factor of 5 when using the proposed longitudinal strain based criterion in comparison with the flexural stiffness based criterion.},

abstract = {The fracture behaviour of joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive and bond line thicknesses of 0.1–4.5 mm has been studied. However, limited research is found on similar joints with thicker bond lines, which are relevant for maritime applications. Therefore, the effect of the adhesive bond line thickness, varying from 0.4 to 10.1 mm, on the mode I fracture behaviour of steel to steel joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive was investigated in this study. An experimental test campaign of double-cantilever beam (DCB) specimens was carried out in laboratory conditions. Five bond line thicknesses were studied: 0.4, 1.1, 2.6, 4.1 and 10.1 mm. Analytical predictions of the experimental load-displacement curves were performed based on the Simple Beam Theory (SBT), the Compliance Calibration Method (CCM) and the Penado-Kanninen (P-K) model. The P-K model was used to determine the mode I strain energy release rate (SERR). The average mode I SERR, GIav., presented similar values for the specimens with adhesive bond line thicknesses of 0.4, 1.1 and 2.6 mm (GI av.=0.71, 0.61, 0.63 N/mm, respectively). However, it increased by approximately 63% for 4.1 mm (GI av.=1.16 N/mm) and decreased by about 10% (in comparison with 4.1 mm) for the 10.1 mm (GI av.=1.04 N/mm). The trend of the GIav. in relation to the bond line thickness is explained by the combination of three factors: the crack path location, the failure surfaces features and the stress field ahead of the crack tip.},

The aim of applying the reinforcement is to reduce the stresses at the deck and extend the fatigue life of orthotropic bridge decks. Three and four point bending fatigue tests were carried out on beam type specimens representing the reinforced deck. Linear elastic simulations using FEA were performed to determine the stress distribution during tests. Results show that the fatigue damage of the reinforcements are caused by the shear stresses at the adhesive layer, for the bonded system, and by the shear stresses at the faces-to-core interface, for the sandwich system. The fatigue strength of the bonded system is not significantly affected by adhesive thicknesses between 1 and 3. mm. The same can be found for the sandwich system with 15. mm and 30. mm polyurethane-core thickness. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim is to reduce the stresses at the fatigue-sensitive details and therefore extend the fatigue life of the OBD by stiffening the existing deck plate. Two retrofitting systems were studied. The bonded system consists of bonding a second steel plate to the existing deck by vacuum infusing a thin adhesive layer (2 mm) between the two steel plates. The sandwich system consists of bonding the second steel plate through a thick polyurethane core (15 mm). The aim of the study was to assess the fatigue performance of both retrofittings. No fatigue damage was detected in the retrofitting layers during fatigue tests after three million cycles of wheel load. The stresses close to the deck-plate-to-stiffener welds decreased by at least 55% when using the bonded steel plates system and 45% when using the sandwich steel plates system. Both systems proved to have sufficient fatigue life to withstand traffic wheel loads running on orthotropic bridge decks and help extend the fatigue life of the existing OBD.},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to evaluate the performance of two adhesively bonded skin-to-stiffener connections: composite stiffener bonded to a Fiber Metal Laminate (FML) skin, representing a hybrid joint, and an Aluminium stiffener bonded to a FML skin, representative for a metal joint. The bonded joints were tested using Stiffener Pull-Off Tests (SPOT), which is a typical set-up used to simulate the structural behavior of full-scale components subject to out-of-plane loading, such as internal pressure of a fuselage or leading edge low pressure zone. In the hybrid joint, the damage initiates at the central noodle of the composite stiffener. Unstable delamination then propagates from the noodle to the tip of the stiffener foot, preferably through the stiffener foot plies (>90% of inter/intra-laminar failure) and, in limited areas, through the adhesive bond line (<10% of cohesive failure). In the metal joint, the failure starts at the tip of the stiffener foot at the adhesive bond line. Unstable debonding then propagates along the stiffeners foot. The complete failure occurs in the adhesive bond line (100% cohesive failure). The loads associated with >90% of inter/intra laminar failure of the composite stiffener (hybrid joint) are 40-60% lower than the ones associated with 100% cohesive failure (metal joint). This research identifies that in order to use the full capacity of adhesively bonded hybrid joints, the adhesion between carbon fibers of the composite laminate, ie intralaminar strength, must be improved. Otherwise, Aluminium stringers are still very competitive.},

This bonded joint was tested using stiffener pull-off tests, which is a typical setup used to simulate full-scale components subject to out-of-plane loading. The failure sequence for all test conditions consist of: (1) damage initiation at the noodle of the CFRP stiffener; (2) damage propagation by delamination from the noodle to the stiffener foot; (3) detachment of the stiffener from the skin. Increasing the temperature, decreases the joint stiffness (40% when compared to RT) and decreasing the temperature decreases the maximum load (50% when compared to RT). The fatigue life initiation of the joint presents a very large scatter but the fatigue life propagation presents more stable results. The fatigue threshold (no damage) is reached at approximately 30% of the maximum load level. The fracture surfaces indicate a predominant inter and intra-laminar failure of the composite under mixed mode I/II. The CFRP stiffener is the weakest link of the bonded FML-skin-to-CFRP-stiffener both for static and fatigue loading.},

Two synthesized bio-epoxy components based on TA, (A) glycidyl ether and (B) glycidyl phosphate ester of TA, were used as a replacement for the toxic epoxy component based on Bisphenol A. The effect of eco-epoxy components on the interface adhesion was measured by the determination of adhesion parameter b, which was compared to the reference epoxy (REF). The increase of adhesion parameter b was 77.5% for A and 151.5% for B. The adhesion of both eco-adhesives was tested using the bell peel test (BPT) with the Al and CFRP adherends. When compared to REF, the average peel load for B was 17.6% (39.3%) and 58.3% (176.9%) higher for the Al and CFRP adherends, respectively. Complete adhesion failure of REF reflected the weak adhesion to both Al and CFRP, which was improved by the addition of eco-epoxy components A and B showing the presence of cohesive failure. The microhardness testing method of interface adhesion was proven to be a fast and reliable testing method, providing a qualitative indication in adhesive selection.},

abstract = {This work investigates the effect of long-term environmental exposure on the performance of composite-to-metal bonded joints. Specimens are manufactured using a carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) co-bonded to a steel member with epoxy adhesive and aged in a salt spray chamber. The mixed-mode fracture behavior of the non-aged and aged specimens is assessed using the mixed-mode bending (MMB) test apparatus. The fracture energy is calculated using the finite elements method and an analytical approach, the strain-based method (SBM). The SBM showed to be a simple and accurate method to obtain the total fracture energy and the fracture mode ratio of the bi-material specimen. Ageing increased the fracture toughness at crack initiation by 27% for specimens loaded at 20% mode II and 7% for specimens loaded at 15% mode II. This can be related to the shear behavior and plasticization of the adhesive material. During crack propagation, the fracture toughness remained similar for specimens loaded at 20% mode II and decreased by 15% in specimens loaded at 15% mode II. Fractography analysis together with chemical characterization showed that the penetration of moisture at the edges of the fracture surface produced adhesive failure in these regions affected by moisture. Moreover, the failure mode at the unaffected regions of the fracture surface shifted from cohesive to a combination of thin-layer cohesive and adhesive failure after ageing. The results contributed to describe the effect of ageing on the fracture behavior of bonded materials.},

abstract = {Adhesive bonding is one of the most suitable joining technologies in terms of weight and mechanical performance for current carbon fiber reinforced polymer aircraft fuselage structures. However, traditional joint topologies such as single overlap joints induce high peel stresses, resulting in sudden failure and low joint strength when compared to metal adherends. This drawback in using carbon fiber reinforced polymer is hindering their performance and efficiency in full-scale structures where joints are essential. The goal of this paper is to review how the joint design can help to improve the lap shear strength of composite bonded joints, to recognize the challenges that still need to be understood and to give insight into new opportunities. The focus is thereby on means to increase the matrix-dominated out-of-plane strength of the adherend in order to postpone delamination failure, as it is known to be the most prone type of failure of composite bonded joints. The paper is divided in two main parts: firstly, a review of topology-related and material-related design parameters is given and secondly, future opportunities to improve out-of-plane strength of CFRP bonded joints yet to be explored are discussed.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to characterize the damage in bi-material steel-to-composite double-lap adhesively-bonded joints using Acoustic Emission (AE). Two different structural adhesives, a ductile (Methacrylate-based) and brittle (Epoxy-based), were used to bond CFRP skins to a steel core. The fabricated joints were loaded in tension while damage evolution was monitored by AE. Due to the difference in the fracture nature of the adhesives “ductile vs. brittle”, different damage mechanisms were observed; including cohesive failure within the adhesive layer, steel deformation, failure at the adhesive/adherends interface (adhesive failure) and delamination in the CFRP skin. To classify these damages by AE, the AE features of each damage mechanism were first obtained by conducting standard tests on the individual constituents. Then, these AE reference patterns were used to train an ensemble decision tree classifier. The best parameters of the ensemble model were obtained by Bayesian optimization, and the confusion matrix showed that the model was sufficiently trained with the accuracy of 99.5% and 99.8% for Methacrylate-based and Epoxy-based specimens respectively. Afterwards, the trained model was used to classify the AE signals of the double-lap specimens. The AE demonstrated that the dominant damage mechanisms in the case of the Methacrylate-based were cohesive and adhesive failures while in the case of the Epoxy-based they were CFRP skin failure and adhesive failure. These results were consistent with the Digital Image Correlation, Fiber Optic Sensor and camera results. This study demonstrates the potential of AE technique for damage characterization of adhesively-bonded bi-material joints.},

The ultrasonic C-scan images showed that the interlaminar damage area induced by the single and 3-impact in ORT-PW architecture is 3 and 2 times smaller than NCF and 2D-PW architectures respectively. The impacted specimens were then subjected to the in-plane compression load. Two indices, one based on the mechanical response and another one based on the AE behavior of the laminates, were proposed to compare the performance of different architectures. These indices showed that the ORT-PW had the best performance among all the architectures. Finally, AE was used to distinguish the different damage mechanisms including: matrix cracking, intra and inter-yarn debonding, defected-fiber breakage, intact-fiber breakage and z-binder fiber breakage in the CAI tests of the architectures.},

abstract = {This study is devoted to the use of acoustic emission technique for a comprehensive damage assessment, that is, damage detection, localization, and classification, of an aeronautical metal-to-composite bonded panel. The structure comprised a titanium panel adhesively bonded to carbon fiber–reinforced plastic omega stringers. The panel contained a small initial artificial debonding between the titanium panel and one of the carbon fiber–reinforced plastic stringers. The panel was subjected to a cyclic increasing in-plane compression load, including loading, unloading, and then reloading to a higher load level, until the final fracture. The generated acoustic emission signals were captured by the acoustic emission sensors, and digital image correlation was also used to obtain the strain field on the surface of the panel during the test. The results showed that acoustic emission can accurately detect the damage onset, localize it, and also trace its evolution. The acoustic emission results not only were consistent with the digital image correlation results, but also managed to detect the damage initiation earlier than digital image correlation. Finally, the acoustic emission signals were clustered using particle swarm optimization method to identify the different damage mechanisms. The results of this study demonstrate the capability of acoustic emission for the comprehensive damage characterization of aeronautical bi-material adhesively bonded structures.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd The aim of this research is to study the influence of moisture absorption at low moisture contents on the creep behaviour of an epoxy adhesive in steel bonded joints. Single lap joints were manufactured using high strength steel adherends and a two-component epoxy adhesive. The single lap joints were tested at load levels corresponding to average lap shear stresses of ± 5%, 15%, 30% and 45% of the dry lap shear strength in both 40 °C air and 40 °C distilled water. Specimens were not pre-aged to be able to analyse the coupled effect of moisture and loading. The test results show that an increase in the load level resulted in an increase in the instantaneous strain and in the creep strain rate. The creep strain of single lap joints loaded in water was generally larger than for the ones loaded in air. For joints loaded in water the creep behaviour was found to be dependent on the moisture concentration in the adhesive. At low moisture percentages creep was suppressed, resulting in a lower instantaneous strain. At higher moisture percentages creep was promoted, resulting in a larger strain rate. The suppression of creep at low moisture percentages is attributed to water molecules bonding to the epoxy macromolecules, resulting in a reduction in molecular mobility and a smaller creep strain. At higher moisture percentages the plasticizing effect of the water dominates, resulting in a larger creep strain. The Maxwell three-element solid model and Kelvin-Voigt three-element solid model were used to simulate the creep behaviour of the single lap joints loaded in air and water. The models gave good representations of the creep response across the different load levels in both water and air, they were however unable to give a correct representation of the instantaneous strain of the single lap joints loaded in water. This is attributed to the models being unable to account for the present short-term relaxation process that is dependent on the moisture concentration.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of the fabric architecture and the z-binding yarns on the compression after multiple impacts behavior of composites. Four fiber architectures are investigated: non-crimp fabric (NCF), 2D plain weave (2D-PW), 3D orthogonal plain (ORT-PW) and twill (ORT-TW) weave. The specimens were subjected to single and multiple low-velocity impacts at different locations with the same energy level (15 J). Non-destructive techniques including ultrasonic C-scanning, X-ray CT and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) are employed to quantitatively analyze and capture the Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID) induced in the specimens. Although the absorbed energy was approximately the same, damage was the least in 3D woven architectures. In the case of compression after impact, 3D woven composites demonstrated a progressive damage behavior with the highest residual strength ($\sim$92%) while 2D plain weave and NCF specimens showed suddenly catastrophic damage and the residual strength of $\sim$65% and $\sim$55% respectively.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors Single lap bonded joints with four different composite adherend stacking sequences were tested and numerically simulated. The aim was to evaluate the effect of the layups on the quasi-static tensile failure of the bonded joints. The study shows that increasing the adherends bending stiffness postpones the damage initiation in the joint. However, this is no longer valid for final failure. The ultimate load is influenced by how the damage progresses. For similar bending stiffness, a layup that leads to the crack propagating from the adhesive towards the inside layers of the composite increases the ultimate load. The failure mode is highly influenced by the orientation of the interface lamina in contact with the adhesive, such that, a 0° interface ply causes failure within the bond line, while a 90° interface ply causes failure inside the composite adherend. Finally, it is concluded that a quasi-isotropic layup may not be the best choice in terms of tensile joint strength. In order to improve tensile strength up to damage initiation, the layup should be optimized for bending stiffness, while up to final failure, a stacking sequence that yields to a complex crack path inside the composite can lead to higher ultimate loads.},

A parametric study was carried out on the flexural behaviour of beams representing the renovation solution using experimental and analytical studies. The influence of different thicknesses, temperatures and spans was tested. The results obtained for the stress reduction factor show that it is independent of temperature. More efficient solutions can be achieved when minimizing the second steel plate thickness and maximizing the adhesive layer thickness reducing the weight and increasing the stiffness of the composite structure. Both elastic behaviour and yield load of the composite beams are dominated by the steel plate properties and therefore not affected significantly by temperature. However, the ultimate failure of the beams occurs by shear of the adhesive layer, the properties of which are affected by temperature. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This work is intended to characterize the mechanical behavior of hybrid carbon–glass composite plates under combined loading of bending and torsion, and to determine the optimal ply fiber orientations to minimize the maximum out-of-plane displacement under such loading conditions. Hybrid composite plates were manufactured with 10 plies each and different stacking sequences using hand lay-up, with carbon fiber and glass fiber reinforcements in an epoxy matrix. Two experimental setups (involving two distinct boundary conditions) are here considered to test the composite plates, both simulating combined loading of bending and torsion. Numerical simulations of the experimental tests were performed in ABAQUS{\textregistered} and validated with the experimental data. Using the ply fiber orientations as design variables, the hybrid composite plates were then optimized using global and local optimization using direct search (GLODS). The objective function of minimization of the maximum out-of-plane displacement is carried out through an interactive cycle between GLODS and ABAQUS{\textregistered}. Specimens of three optimized laminates were also manufactured for experimental validation. The optimization process contributed to improve the performance of the hybrid composite plates in more than 30% when compared to some non-optimized plates.},

abstract = {The bondline thickness is a crucial parameter affecting the strength and toughness of adhesive joints. This parameter is responsible for the stress distribution, and thus, the efficiency of the stress transfer between the adherends, the failure modes, and the correspondent failure loads. However, the available literature reports different trends and relationships during testing between the thickness and strength, or thickness and toughness. In this chapter, the effect of adhesive thickness on the mechanical properties of adhesive joints is explored using the fracture mechanics framework. Two testing cases are discussed in detail: (i) soft bondlines joining rigid adherends, that is, butt joint and single end notch testing specimens, and (ii) rigid bondlines joining flexible adherends, that is, double cantilever beam geometry. These cases represent two extremes in terms of where the energy is stored while testing: in the first one, the energy is stored in the adhesive while in the second, the energy is stored in the adherends. From this discussion, the bondline thickness emerges as a critical geometrical parameter dictating transition between the two extreme cases. A single theoretical framework is provided that merges the two cases and is used to disclose the recently obtained experimental results.},

The results show that floating roller peel tests, widely used in metal bonding, can also be used to assess adhesion properties of composite bonding and composite-to-aluminium bonding. However, attention should be paid on which results are important to take from the peel tests. In adhesion tests, the failure mode is more important than the failure load. The peel load can only be compared when using exactly the same type of flexible adherend. Even when the adhesion properties are good (cohesive failure), the peel load value can decrease up to a factor of 10 when peeling off a composite flexible adherend instead of an aluminium flexible adherend.

abstract = {This study uses the acoustic emission structural health monitoring method to identify fracture mechanisms in composite bonded joints when varying the substrate stacking sequence. Quasi-static mode I loading tests were performed on secondary adhesively bonded multidirectional composite substrates (0, 90, 45, −45, 60 and −60° fibre orientations). An unsupervised artificial neural network combined with the visual fracture evaluation of the specimens and the Morlet continuous wavelet transform was used to cluster and give the acoustic emission signals a physical meaning. Different fracture mechanisms could be identified within the adhesive layer (i.e., cohesive failure) and in the composite substrates, including non-visible damage mechanisms (matrix micro-cracking, fibre/matrix debonding, fibre pull-out and fibre breakage). Using the Morlet continuous wavelet transform, it was possible to recognise that the highest peak frequency does not always represent the most relevant signature of the fracture mechanism. Moreover, multiple peak frequencies can be associated with multiple fracture mechanisms, such as the fibre pull-out that occurs in the combination of matrix cracking and fibre breakage. Furthermore, no differences were observed in mode I loading conditions between the acoustic emission signatures from the cohesive failure in the adhesive layer and the matrix cracking within the composite substrate. The findings of this study present a great opportunity to gain more insight into the fracture behaviour of polymer materials and fibre-reinforced polymer materials and to improve the quality of adhesively bonded joints.},

Especially fibre reinforced polymer composites are nowadays often bonded to metals in order to take the most advantage of the materials properties and to minimize their disadvantages. However, the interface in such bi-material assemblies often represents the weakest point and thus has to be carefully addressed to ensure structural integrity. This review paper presents an overview of the research on bi-material interface crack problems over the past 30 years. Three categories of the research are discussed: mechanical testing, crack driving force and mode partitioning. The literature reveals that the key element to the fracture analysis of the bi-material interface crack is how to perform the mode partitioning. The proposed theories for mode partitioning by many researchers are meaningful yet underdeveloped and need further experimental validation.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the use of composite laminated structures in the automobile, railroad, civil, aeronautical, space and naval industries is growing at a huge rate. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in sandwich laminated structures, whose bending capability and performance is much better when compared to classical laminates. Sandwich structures, which are mainly used as bending components, are formed by materials with very different stiffness in the faces and in the core. Therefore the behaviour of such structures under bending conditions does not fit the classical laminate theories. Despite this, sandwich structures are simple enough to allow simplified analysis, whose mathematical accuracy depends greatly on the structure itself. In this paper the goal is to study and validate the application in bending of a developed sandwich beam element with transverse compressibility of the core. This element uses a mixed layerwise approach by considering a higher-order shear deformation theory (HSDT) to represent the displacement field of the core and a first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for the face layers. Results are compared with three-dimensional finite element solutions and validation is also conducted with values retrieved experimentally. {\textcopyright} Civil-Comp Press, 2012.},
