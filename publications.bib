  abstract = {The development of new adhesives has allowed to expand the application of bonding into the most diverse industrial fields. This review article presents the commonly used experimental methods for the investigation of mechanical performance of adhesively bonded joints in the aerospace, wind energy, automotive and civil engineering sectors. In these sectors, due to their excellent intrinsic properties, composite materials are often used along with conventional materials such as steel, concrete and aluminium. In this context, and due to the limitations that the traditional joining techniques present, adhesive joints are an excellent alternative. However, standardized experimental procedures are not always applicable for testing representative adhesive joints in these industries. Lack of relevant regulations across the different fields is often overcome by the academia and companies' own regulations and standards. Additional costs are thus mitigated to the industrial sectors in relation with the certification process which effectively can deprive even the biggest companies from promoting adhesive bonding. To ensure continuous growth of the adhesive bonding field the new international standards, focusing on actual adhesive joints' performance rather than on specific application of adhesive joints are necessary.},

The effect of high-temperature oxidation on the fracture toughness was also evaluated by testing a batch of joints in which the titanium underwent a post-printing thermal treatment. The as-printed specimens were compared to the same type of joints but with sandblasted titanium adherends to evaluate the effect of this surface pre-treatment on the value of fracture toughness. The results indicate that non-oxidised titanium joints with untreated adherends had an average of 11\% higher fracture toughness than their sandblasted counterparts. On the other hand, sandblasting proved beneficial for oxidised joints, increasing the fracture toughness by 64\% on average over the untreated samples.},

Quasi-static mode I loading tests were performed on secondary adhesively bonded multidirectional composite substrates (0, 90, 45, -45, 60 and -60{$^\circ$} fibre orientations). An unsupervised artificial neural network combined with the visual fracture evaluation of the specimens and the Morlet continuous wavelet transform was used to cluster and give the acoustic emission signals a physical meaning. Different fracture mechanisms could be identified within the adhesive layer (i.e., cohesive failure) and in the composite substrates, including non-visible damage mechanisms (matrix micro-cracking, fibre/matrix debonding, fibre pull-out and fibre breakage). Using the Morlet continuous wavelet transform, it was possible to recognise that the highest peak frequency does not always represent the most relevant signature of the fracture mechanism. Moreover, multiple peak frequencies can be associated with multiple fracture mechanisms, such as the fibre pull-out that occurs in the combination of matrix cracking and fibre breakage. Furthermore, no differences were observed in mode I loading conditions between the acoustic emission signatures from the cohesive failure in the adhesive layer and the matrix cracking within the composite substrate. The findings of this study present a great opportunity to gain more insight into the fracture behaviour of polymer materials and fibre-reinforced polymer materials and to improve the quality of adhesively bonded joints.},

Quasi-static Double Cantilever Beam tests were performed using four different CFRP layups bonded with two adhesives. Parallel to the experimental program, finite element analyses were performed to aid in understanding and identifying the various damage mechanisms in each specimen type. The results show that the CFRP layup and adhesive fracture toughness significantly influence the joint fracture phenomena at crack onset and further crack propagation. An enhancement of the joint's mode I fracture toughness values at crack onset was observed in the specimens where a crack competition between the propagation within the bondline and the composite's layers was triggered. During crack propagation, the fracture toughness of the joint increases at crack deflections between the different plies of the CFRP layup until reaching the 0{$^\circ$} ply, where sudden delamination occurs. It has been shown that CFRP layup tailoring is a promising toughening method that, when carefully designed, has the potential to increase the maximum effective fracture toughness up to 100\% when compared to pure cohesive failure.},

Single-material (i.e. steel-steel and GFRP-GFRP) and bi-material (i.e. steel-GFRP) double-cantilever beam joints bonded with a structural epoxy adhesive are tested. The joints are modelled analytically, considering a beam on elastic-plastic foundation, to include characteristic length scales of the problem (e.g. adhesive thickness, plastic zone) and numerically using Finite Element Model. An empirical relation, in terms of geometrical and material properties of the joints, that defines the transition between non-cohesive and cohesive fracture onset is found. Above a specific pre-crack length the stress singularity at pre-crack tip rules over the stress singularity near bi-material corners, resulting in mid-adhesive thickness cohesive fracture onset. However, the cracking direction rapidly deflects out from the adhesive layer centre-line. Positive T-stress along the crack tip is found to be one of the factors for the unstable crack path.},

The safe life philosophy, commonly employed in the design of bonded joints, underscores the importance of obtaining an accurate estimate of the adhesive's durability. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the predictive capabilities of the adhesive's mechanical behavior under cyclic ageing conditions. This research aims to expand the use of quasi-static cohesive zone modelling (CZM) for damage and fracture analysis of dissimilar adhesive joints subjected to cyclic ageing environments. The first step involved measuring the mechanical properties of the adhesive through tensile tests on unaged and cyclically aged dogbone specimens, considering their moisture content and ageing cycles. Based on the results, a degradable CZM was developed. To validate the numerical model, dissimilar double cantilever beam specimens (DCBs) of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aluminium were manufactured and tested before and after ageing. The load-displacement curves of the bi-materials bonded joints were successfully predicted using the developed model where the properties of the material are defined as a function of the moisture uptake and ageing cycles at each material element. The obtained results showed that after 4 ageing cycles, the maximum load of DCB specimens decrease considerably.},

Though some comprehensive studies on the aging of adhesives exist, these researches mainly focus on monotonic aging conditions where the adhesive joints are exposed to a wet condition continuously for a long time. However, the few investigations performed on the cyclic moisture absorption of adhesive materials show that the parameters obtained in monotonic aging conditions are not suitable for estimation of the aging behaviour of adhesive exposed to alternating humidity. An important question that can arise is whether or not this frequency affects the mechanical behaviour of adhesive joints under cyclic aging condition. In this investigation bulk dogbone and square samples were manufactured, subjected to cyclic aging conditions with four different aging frequencies and tested. The results show that the moisture diffusion constant of adhesives exposed to higher aging frequencies increase more than those exposed to lower aging frequency conditions. In addition, the moisture content only affects the degradation of strength and stiffness of the tested adhesives in different aging frequencies.},

For this type of joints, the investigation of the fracture behaviour under pure mode I loading is a vital issue. In order to study mode I fracture parameters of adhesive joints, scientists have proposed standard double cantilever beam (DCB) specimens. In dissimilar DCB adhesive joints, because of material asymmetry, obtaining pure mode I is challenging. To obtain pure mode I loading in dissimilar DCB joints, scientists have proposed two criteria based on (1) the flexural stiffness and (2) the distribution of the longitudinal strain along the bondline. However, the achievement of pure mode I in dissimilar DCB joints needs more research. In this paper, the mode-mixity in dissimilar DCB joints designed based on the two mentioned criteria is investigated numerically and experimentally. Metalcomposite DCBs were fabricated and tested. During the tensile tests, the horizontal and vertical displacement fields of the adhesive layer were calculated using digital image correlation (DIC) and the finite element method (FEM). Based on the obtained displacement fields and using Williams' series expansion, the mode-mixities were investigated. The results show that in order to achieve pure mode I loading in steel-composite joints, the criterion based on longitudinal strain is more suitable and in aluminium-composite joints the mode-mixities given by two criteria are almost the same.},

In this study, an epoxy matrix reinforced with flax fiber is proposed as the material for the patches, and bonded to a steel plate using four different types of adhesive materials, including a castor-oil derived polyurethane resin. Floating roller peel tests were performed to assess the adhesion and viability of these new patches. The resulting peeling loads and fracture surface analysis are presented.

However, the material asymmetry in such designed joints results in mode II fracture as well. In this paper, a new design criterion is proposed to obtain pure mode I fracture in adhesively bonded bi-material DCB joints by matching the longitudinal strain distributions of the two adherends at the bondline - longitudinal strain based criterion. A test program and Finite Element modelling have been carried out to verify the proposed design criterion using composite-metal bonded DCB joints. Both the experimental and numerical results show that pure mode I can be achieved in bi-material joints designed with the proposed criterion. GII/GI ratio is reduced by a factor of 5 when using the proposed longitudinal strain based criterion in comparison with the flexural stiffness based criterion.},

These structures have inspired reinforcements of synthetic polymer materials to enhance toughness. In this study, we mimic these natural toughening mechanisms by designing and manufacturing 3D-printed polymeric structures incorporating overlapping curls consisting of coiling fiber with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths. Utilizing the liquid rope coiling effect, we manufactured overlapping curls using three polymers: polylactic acid (PLA), liquid crystal polymer (LCP), and polyamide 6 (PA6). Uniaxial tensile tests were performed to characterize the mechanical properties of overlapping curl as a function of geometries, post-treatments, and material constitutive parameters. Our results show that single-sided overlapping curls can fully unfold while double-sided curls are prone to premature failure. Heat-pressure post-treatment was found to significantly increase the load-capacity of the sacrificial bonds by up to Image 1 due to increased contact area. However, the defects introduced in the fibre after the break of the sacrificial bonds, make the structure more susceptible to premature failure, limit the complete unfolding of the hidden length, and lead to a decrease up to Image 2 of the toughness. To guarantee the complete unfolding of the hidden lengths and improve the toughness, we demonstrate that selecting a polymer material with either high fracture strength (e.g., LCP, Image 3) or high fracture strain (e.g., PA6, {$>$}2) is crucial, and increase toughness up to Image 4 and Image 5, respectively.},
