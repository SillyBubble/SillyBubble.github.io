  abstract = {This work aims to improve the damage tolerance of secondary adhesively bonded joints under quasistatic mode I loading conditions by architecting the carbon fibre-reinforced polymer substrates' stacking sequences [1]. Double Cantilever Beam tests show that architecting the stacking sequence of the laminates composite substrates in combination with the adhesive layer's fracture toughness affects the crack onset and triggers different crack paths throughout the joints' thickness. In specimens bonded with a low-toughness bi-component adhesive, the tailored design, including a co-cured toughening layer, could increase the effective fracture toughness of the composite bonded joints up to 200\%. From this study, it was possible to recognise the complexity and benefits of moving from the traditional cohesive failure to outbreaking multiple crack path propagation.},

  abstract = {Bio-based epoxy materials face major challenges in their relatively poor mechanical properties compared to their petroleum-based competitors, including low fracture toughness and abrupt failure. By mimicking the molecular structure of spider silk, which is one of the toughest materials in nature, we manufactured polymer overlapping curls consisting of coiling fibers with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths through 3D printing. These curls were embedded in a bio-based epoxy aiming to improve its toughness. The bio-based epoxy adhesive layer integrated by such 3D-printed coiling fibers was tested under mode I opening load using Double Cantilever Beam tests. The results show an extrinsic bridging triggered by the embedded curls that promote progressive failure and improve the mode I fracture toughness by 285\%. The proposed 3D-printed coiling fibers can improve the performance of biobased epoxies and retard crack growth, opening new horizons for their use in structural applications and the use of these bio-inspired overlapping curls to control crack growth in adhesively bonded joints.},

  abstract = {For strengthening or rehabilitation of existing structures, patches of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) materials are being adhesively bonded to the existing metallic structures. So far, Carbon FRP (CFRP) are the main composite materials industrially implemented for metal structural reinforcement, due to their reliability and high mechanical performances. However, multiple researchers have highlighted the negative environmental impact of synthetic composite materials, and interest is shifting towards the use and development of bio-based composite materials. This paper presents an FE numerical investigation of the use of Hybrid Carbon/Flax FRP as an alternative solution for structural reinforcement of steel plates under flexural loading. Four different configurations of patches are studied to be bonded to steel rectangular plates, and three point bending tests are numerically modelled to simulate the flexural behaviour of the assemblies. Compared to the unreinforced steel plate baseline, reinforcements C5, F5, CFFFC, and FFFCC exhibited improvements of 149\%, 120\%, 137\%, and 145\% in bending stiffness, respectively.},

  abstract = {Aiming to aid the sustainable transition to fossil fuel-free epoxy materials and enhance the toughness of bio-based epoxies, here we integrate an overlapping curl microstructure consisting of coiling fiber with sacrificial bonds and hidden lengths into a bio-based epoxy matrix. Inspired by natural material, where exceptional properties are achieved at low environmental cost, the microstructure mimics the molecular structures of spider silk, known for its exceptional fracture resistance. The 3D-printed overlapping curl shows a saw-tooth mechanical response with continuous load-carrying ability thanks to the break of sacrificial bonds and unfolding of the hidden lengths. By embedding the overlapping curl into the compact-tension configuration of the bio-based epoxy, an extrinsic toughening mechanism is triggered as the hidden length unfolds. Experimental results show that a single-sided overlapping curl structure is able to improve the toughness of bio-based epoxy by 19\%.},
